  // A testWidgets body runs inside a FakeAsync zone. A library that has never
  // been loaded cannot finish loading there: pump() advances fake time while
  // the load waits on the real event loop, so the page sits on its loading
  // state forever. Calling loadLibrary inside tester.runAsync instead
  // deadlocks outright -- the suite produced no output at all and was killed
  // by its timeout, which reads exactly like a slow compile and was blamed on
  // one for weeks.
  //
  // So: load them for real up here, where setUpAll is ordinary async. That is
  // still not enough on its own, because the generated page caches the future
  // it created in this zone, and a future handed to a FutureBuilder in a
  // different zone never delivers -- every page then shows its loading state,
  // including the ones that loaded fine.
  //
  // Dropping the cache before each test makes the page call loadLibrary again
  // inside its own zone, where the library is by now already loaded, so the
  // new future completes at once.

  // an indirection that existed only because @DVPage once required an
  // expression body. It does not any more, so the pages are private and this
  // renders what ships.
  // No loadLibrary here, and that is the fix rather than an omission.
  //
  // This used to call it inside tester.runAsync, on the theory that the
  // deferred library resolves on the real event loop which pump() does not
  // drain. runAsync around loadLibrary deadlocks: the suite produced no
  // output at all and was killed by its timeout, which reads exactly like a
  // slow compile and was blamed on one for weeks.
  //
  // It is also unnecessary. The Dart VM does not split deferred libraries, so
  // in a test they are already loaded and the generated page's FutureBuilder
  // resolves on the next pump.
