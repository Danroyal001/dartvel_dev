// Motion, and the one rule that governs all of it.
//
// Every animation here is off when the reader has asked for reduced motion.
// That is a system setting people turn on because movement makes them ill,
// and a site that ignores it is not being lively, it is being rude. It costs
// one check -- context.screen.reducedMotion -- which reads the platform
// setting as well as any explicit DV.Accessibility override.
//
// Reveal-on-scroll and lift-on-hover used to live here as StatefulWidgets.
// They are DVModifier.revealOnScroll() and DVModifier.hover() now: they are
// framework concerns, and having them here meant every application that
// wanted either wrote its own and remembered the reduced-motion check by hand.
//
// What is left is the two animations that are specific to this site, and
// neither needs a State: a tween that runs once on first build is exactly
// what TweenAnimationBuilder is.
