    'its own axis -- a card padded 24 across and 32 down is drawn that way, '
    'an elevated card is elevated, and a screen taller than the phone it runs '
    'on scrolls instead of showing the overflow stripe. A text node names its '
    'typeface and its line height, and a box can be painted with a gradient, '
    'rounded at some corners and not others, and placed by coordinate inside '
    'a stack; an image says how it fills its box, so a logo is not cropped to '
    'look like a photograph, and a text node says how many lines it gets, so '

    'An image can be one the application holds rather than one it points at -- a key in file storage, read once however many times the page draws it -- so an imported design does not depend on somebody else\'s URL still working. Everything the page draws is in the exported source, which is handed to '

    'components become components, auto-layout keeps its spacing and '
    'alignment, strokes and fades and centred text survive, images are '
    'downloaded and kept rather than linked to URLs that expire, and a node '
    'keeps the size it was drawn at only where the designer fixed it -- so '
    'the result is not pinned to the width of the artboard. Padding arrives on '
    'all four sides, shadows arrive, and a screen whose content runs past its '
    'own frame scrolls: Figma positions everything absolutely, so the import '
    'can measure that rather than guess at it -- and it uses those same '
    'coordinates to keep hand-placed elements where they were drawn, relative '
    'to the frame they are in. Typefaces, line heights, gradients, corners '
    'that differ and the way each image fills its frame all arrive, and so do '
    'the icons -- vector paths carry no image '
    'fill, so Figma is asked to render each one and the picture is kept, '

    'Home Widgets',
    'Generated pages, packaged on Android and on Apple',
    'Present: @DVHomeWidget on any widget generates the page the specification describes -- a route at /widgets/<id> that centres the widget\'s content, which is what lets the widget launch the application at itself and a page navigate back to it -- and the application\'s list of them beside the router, for the packaging that puts them on a home screen. The identifier is the class name in kebab case, one rule in one place: a widget somebody has already put on their home screen is found again by it, and two spellings of the route is a tap that opens the not-found page. A build for a target with no home screen leaves them out and says which ones and why, or is refused outright when the project asks to be -- what must never happen is the third option, a widget quietly carried into an artifact that can never show it. On Android it is packaged: a provider, the metadata a launcher reads before anybody places one, a layout, and a receiver in the manifest. It draws the platform\'s own views rather than the Flutter tree, because a home screen is composed in the launcher\'s process and that cannot host a Flutter engine -- and the tap is what the specification actually asks for, a deep link to the page Dartvel generated. On iOS and macOS it is packaged as WidgetKit: a separate bundle with its own sources, Info.plist and entitlements, and an Xcode target spliced into the project that builds it, embeds it in the application and waits for it rather than racing it. Only one of the ways that goes wrong is loud -- a project file Xcode cannot parse -- and the rest are silent: a target absent from the project\'s target list is never built, an extension with no embed phase is built and left behind, and a second build that appended rather than replaced would give Xcode two targets with one name. The App Group is claimed at both ends, because an extension entitled to read a container the application never writes to renders its placeholder forever and nothing errors at either end. SwiftUI rather than the Flutter tree, for the same reason Android draws the platform\'s own views. The tap lands on both now: the URL arrives at the iOS app delegate, so the build writes the capture there -- two overrides, because a cold launch carries the URL in the launch options and never reaches open(url:) while a warm one arrives there with no launch options, and an implementation with one of them works in whichever case somebody happened to try. The Dart side reads it back and takes it away again, since a link left in the defaults would be opened on every later start. The shell properties are the page\'s now: @DVHomeWidget takes the arguments @DVPage takes, through the same parser, and the generated page is wrapped in the shell that applies them. It could not carry them at all before, because both scanners matched @DVHomeWidget() with the parentheses empty -- so writing what the specification describes deleted the widget without a word, and the annotation sat in the file saying otherwise. The title is the property that also leaves the application: a launcher\'s picker and the widget gallery each ask for a name and each were handed the identifier, so a widget was offered to people as step-counter, a route segment, among the names of their applications. Sharing the tree and the state is built as far as the platform allows, and the limit is stated rather than worked around: the surface on a home screen is composed in a process that cannot host a Flutter engine, so what is shared is the page at /widgets/<id> -- the same widget, the application\'s own tree, the same signals and globals as every other page -- and what crosses to the home screen is data. That crossing did not exist: the generated Swift read a key nothing wrote and the Android provider drew a constant, which is a widget showing its own name for ever and looks exactly like one that works. DVHomeWidgets.publish writes it, through one key rule in core that all three halves read, because a key spelled twice is a correctly built and correctly signed widget showing its placeholder for ever. Absent: an immediate refresh on Apple, since WidgetCenter is Swift-only and has no Objective-C class to message, so a published value is picked up on the timeline the provider asked for rather than at once; and @DVHomeWidget on a class rather than a function, which the declaration pattern reads as the class being extended.',

    'Modules',
    'Mounted, with their routes, a verified manifest and their deployment modes',
    'Present: a module is a whole Dartvel application a parent mounts. The build finds it, takes its own route base off and puts the mount point on -- /products/:id standalone is /store/products/:id mounted -- generates the module before the parent, and serves its pages from the parent\'s router; they are in the route index and sitemap, tagged with the module they came from, and DV.Modules.<id> is the module the build mounted. Its assets are the paths that find them in the parent, its pages are typed targets that keep their names wherever it is mounted, and its globals are its own -- shared only where the declaration says: the module\'s pubspec names what it exports, the parent\'s what it hands down, and DV.Modules.<id>.global<T>() refuses anything else by naming the line that would allow it. A federated module publishes a signed manifest, generated from its own project by dartvel modules manifest so it cannot go stale, carrying its own routes rather than any parent\'s mount -- its identifier, version, routes, capabilities, assets, modes, public functions and signals, the parent it needs and where it is served from -- and the parent verifies it before mounting: a manifest edited after signing, one signed by a key it does not trust, one for a different module, an older version replayed over one already accepted, routes that collide with its own, or a capability the target lacks are each refused with the reason. A module says what hardware it needs and a build for a device profile refuses when that profile does not provide it or a fallback, so an image is not shipped to a lobby with a section that cannot run on it. dartvel doctor fails on a module the build cannot mount -- a missing project, a manifest that will not verify -- because an application that ships without the section on a green build is how a rotated signing key goes unnoticed. A federated module is mounted from its verified manifest rather than from the source beside it, and generates no import and no page: it is deployed elsewhere, and building a second copy from source would work until the two versions differed. Its routes still appear in the parent\'s route index and sitemap, under the parent\'s own domain, and the parent answers them by sending the reader to the module with the matched parameters carried across -- /store/products/7 arrives there as /products/7 -- so a micro-site serves its own HTML without disappearing from the site it is part of. Each module\'s shell, auth, theme and data modes are read and reach the running application, with a federated module defaulting to what its own deployment can honour and an explicit auth: inherit or data: shared on one refused -- there is no parent session to inherit and no shared database, so it would run with neither and read as a login bug. A split-backend module\'s client asks the registry where its own functions answer before falling back to the application it was compiled into, so the same module calls its own API standing alone and its deployed service when mounted; declared without an address it is refused, because the only other symptom would be a 404 from an application that looks right. What a module compiled into the parent contributes is the parent\'s to run: its backend functions answer in the parent\'s router at the module\'s own paths, its cron functions are in the parent\'s schedule, its AI tools in the parent\'s tool table, and its tables are created with the parent\'s when it shares the database. Two functions claiming one path, or two models one table, are refused rather than one of them quietly losing. A split-backend or federated module contributes none of it, running its own in its own deployment. A module\'s auth mode decides whether the parent\'s guard applies to its routes: inherit puts them behind it, public leaves them open, because a documentation module mounted into an application everybody has to sign into is a documentation module nobody can read. A module\'s theme mode decides what its pages render in and its shell mode what surrounds them -- inherit, extend, override or isolated for the first, and none as well for the second, with theme outermost so a module that overrides both is drawn in its own theme inside its own chrome. Its data mode decides where its models live: the parent\'s tables shared, its own names in the parent\'s database when schema-isolated, its own database when database-isolated, and refused outright when remote, because a module whose data is somewhere else has no table here to read. Every mode is applied at run time now rather than merely read.',

A subject with an accent in it went down the wire as raw UTF-8 in a header that has to be ASCII: the server took it, and the clients that do not guess the encoding show it as mojibake to whoever was sent it. The body declared no transfer encoding, which means seven-bit, which it was not. Both are fixed and both are now checked against a server rather than against a connection this repository wrote.

    'Desktop, Embedded, and Qt-Critical Capabilities',
    'Built on Linux, and most of it on Windows and macOS',
    'Present on Linux: global shortcuts, the application menu, printing, system dialogs, file associations, app links and deep links, the launch that opens what the app was started with, the device and fleet APIs -- manifest, health, watchdog, provisioning, diagnostics -- and startup measured phase by phase, published beside the live window list and carried in the diagnostics bundle. Present on Windows and macOS, each proven on its own runner: global shortcuts delivered by id, the application menu, the tray icon with its menu, and the device APIs. An application registers what it opens while it is running, on all three -- the user\'s own desktop entry and MIME package on Linux, the per-user half of the registry on Windows, the running bundle with LaunchServices on macOS -- which is the half an installer normally does and an application copied into place has nobody to do. Drag and drop is present on all three: a window takes the files or the text the desktop drops on it and says where it landed, through GTK on Linux, an OLE drop target on Windows and a dragging destination on macOS. The tray is present on all three too, on Linux as a StatusNotifierItem and its menu on the session bus. NFC is present on Linux through neard -- whether there is a reader that could read now and what is on the tag, with no tag answering as nothing and no reader saying so. Writing one is present too -- the half that hands somebody a card rather than reading theirs -- and it is fussier than it sounds, because nearly every way it goes wrong still reports success: a link goes into a URI record and not into text that looks like one, since a link written as text reads back correctly and does nothing when a phone touches it; a text record carries the language code NDEF requires and some readers show an empty record without; an empty value is refused, because a tag written with nothing on it cannot be told from one never written; and a locked tag is refused with the reason, so nobody presents the same card twice. Bluetooth is present on Linux through BlueZ: whether the radio is on, the adapters, and every device the machine knows about, so a fleet can tell a peripheral that is unpaired from one that is out of range -- and a machine with no bluetooth service at all says that rather than answering with an empty list. Pairing, connecting and forgetting are present too, which is what lets a fleet fix a reader that has come unpaired instead of sending somebody to the lobby. The answers are the fussy part: a device already paired is a success and not a failure, so nothing retries forever against hardware that works; a pairing that failed because no agent is registered says that, because on a device with nobody standing at it there is no passkey to answer and the radio is not the problem; connecting something unpaired says to pair it first rather than leaving a timeout to be explained; and forgetting asks the adapter the device is actually on, since on a machine with two the other one removes nothing and reports success. The USB bus is present on Linux -- what is plugged in, with each device\'s ids and what it says about itself, which is what tells a fleet the scanner is unplugged rather than broken. Talking to one is present too, through usbfs: open it, claim the interface, write and read. The ioctl numbers are computed from one rule and checked against the kernel headers, because each packs four fields and getting any of them wrong still produces a valid ioctl for something else. The errors say what they actually mean on a device node -- a permission error is a udev rule nobody wrote rather than a bug in the calling code, a busy interface is a kernel driver holding it that has to be detached, and a timeout is a device that may answer next time rather than one that has gone. The serial port is present on all three desktops: the ports with stable names, opened in raw mode -- because a line left in a terminal\'s default mode turns carriage returns into newlines and stops at the first 0x1a, so text works and the first binary frame arrives short -- read with a timeout, written, closed, and exercised in CI against a real pseudo-terminal on both -- macOS is a port rather than a copy, since its termios and its baud rates are not Linux\'s. Windows is the third: the ports come from the list Windows itself keeps in the registry, sorted by number so COM10 comes after COM9 rather than before it, every one of them opened through the device-namespace path and not only the ones above COM9, and an open that fails says which port and why in words -- not there, or held by another program -- rather than a number somebody has to go and look up. An eLinux bundle boots into the application: autostart, restartOnFailure and a declared watchdog become the systemd unit beside it, and CI hands that unit to systemd itself, so a directive systemd would reject is found at build time rather than at boot. Absent: USB transfers, Bluetooth pairing and I/O, and writing NFC tags.',

Native enforcement is present on embedded Linux, where it means something different from everywhere else: there is no window manager, so the application already owns the display and what has to be stopped is somebody leaving it. A virtual terminal switch puts a login prompt in front of a running kiosk without the application ever knowing, and the console underneath paints kernel messages over the framebuffer while the application draws on it. Both are held, both are attempted independently so a device that allows one gets the one it can, and whatever could not be held is named with the reason and carries DV-KIOSK-007 -- because a kiosk that could not hold and says nothing reads exactly like one that did. Five containment keys in the specification -- an external-route rule, clipboard and text-selection blocking, cursor hiding and screen dimming -- are read by nothing. The parser took the routes, input and display maps and pulled three named children out of each, so those five were read straight past. They are named as problems now, because an unrecognised value always produced one while an unrecognised key produced nothing, and that is the worse of the two: somebody who writes the clipboard rule into a kiosk has decided the clipboard is locked, and silence reads as agreement. Absent: native enforcement on iPadOS, Tizen and webOS, and what those five keys should do -- blocking a clipboard has no binding on most targets yet, and an external route needs a meaning distinct from the allow list before anything can enforce it.',
