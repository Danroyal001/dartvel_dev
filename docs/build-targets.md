# Build targets and toolchains

What `dartvel build <target>` supports, what each target needs installed, and
what has actually been verified rather than assumed.

Every "verified" row below was produced by running the command and inspecting
the artifact. Rows that are not verified say so and say why.

---

## Verified status

Verified on Linux x64 (Ubuntu 24.04), Flutter 3.44.5 / Dart 3.12.2. Most
Flutter targets were verified against `examples/dartvel_example`; the VS Code
target was verified against a disposable copy of `examples/basic_app` with the
local Dartvel `dartvel_vscode` fork added as a dependency.


> **The native server is opt-in.** `dartvel_shelf.dll`, `libdartvel_shelf.so`

> and they are there because the example application serves a Dartvel backend
> and says so:

> binaries that never listen, at 6.5-7.2 MB each. An application that only
> calls a remote API now ships none of it.


| Target | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `web` | ✅ Builds | `build/web` (43 MB) with `flutter_bootstrap.js`, `main.dart.js`, assets, CanvasKit; Wasm dry run passes |
| `linux` | ✅ Builds and **runs** | `build/linux/x64/release/bundle/dartvel_example`, 23.8 KB launcher + bundle. Runtime-verified under Xvfb: the release binary ran headless (software EGL), stayed alive, and a root-window screenshot showed the full UI — `DV.Platform` live-reporting `linux`/`desktop`, signals active (`showcase-ready`). The first target verified by running, not only building. **Re-verified 2026-08-15** after the native-asset hook was rewritten (`976ccfa8`, `db93571b`): the hook compiled `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` from an empty target directory, `libdartvel_shelf.so` (6.5 MB) was bundled into `bundle/lib/`, and the binary ran and rendered as before |
| `android` | ✅ Builds | `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`, 47.9 MB |
| `fireos` | ✅ Builds | Same APK path; `fireos` maps onto the Android toolchain |
| `windows` | ✅ Builds | **Verified on a Windows runner**, artifact downloaded and inspected rather than inferred: `dartvel_example.exe` (89 KB, PE32+ executable GUI x86-64), `dartvel_shelf.dll` (7.2 MB, the Rust runtime), `flutter_windows.dll`, `data/`. Run [32587129093](https://github.com/Danroyal001/dartvel_dev/actions/runs/32587129093). Took eight attempts and **seven bugs** — two earlier runs had burned 257 and 226 minutes in silence. Four of the seven were not Windows quirks but silent corruption on every platform, exposed only because a Windows path forced the issue: `esc` never escaped backslashes; `routeFromRel` normalised separators with a doubled backslash and stripped its prefix before normalising; the same doubled-backslash fault sat in six more sites across two packages; and four glob patterns were built with `p.join`, where the separator is always `/` and a backslash is the escape character. See [Windows](#windows) |
| `macos` | ✅ Builds | **Verified on a macOS runner**, artifact downloaded and inspected: `dartvel_example.app/Contents/MacOS/dartvel_example` is a **Mach-O universal binary (x86_64 + arm64)**, with `dartvel_shelf.framework` — the Rust runtime — bundled into `Contents/Frameworks`. Run [32602765861](https://github.com/Danroyal001/dartvel_dev/actions/runs/32602765861). The 41-minute silence was never Flutter: the native asset hook buffered its output, so a long C compile was indistinguishable from a wedge. Bounding and streaming it turned the hang into a visible failure, which turned out to be **cc-rs invoked with no `-isysroot`** — `SDKROOT` was unset, so every C crate (`ring`, `zstd-sys`, `aws-lc-sys`) failed to find its headers. The hook now asks `xcrun` for the SDK path, chosen from the target rather than the host. `aws-lc-rs` was also dropped: it is rustls's default provider, this crate uses `ring`, and it was compiling a large C codebase for nothing on every platform. See [macOS](#macos) |
| `ios` | ✅ Builds | **Verified on a macOS runner**, not this host: `build/ios/iphoneos/Runner.app` (15.4 MB), artifact directory listed. Run [31554165981](https://github.com/Danroyal001/dartvel_dev/actions/runs/31554165981) |
| `tvos` | ✅ Builds | **Verified on a macOS runner**: scaffold auto-generated, then `build/tvos/Debug-appletvsimulator/Runner.app`. The `appletvsimulator` path is the proof it is a tvOS app and not the iPhone app an earlier mapping produced. Run [32538073146](https://github.com/Danroyal001/dartvel_dev/actions/runs/32538073146). See [tvOS](#tvos) |
| `tizen` / `tpk` | ✅ Builds | Signed 9.3MB TPK with engine + assets, built on a laptop with Tizen Studio installed. CI can only ever *skip* it — the SDK is licence-gated and Dartvel must not install it unattended — so the workflow asserts the skip names that reason. See [Tizen](#tizen-samsung) |
| `sony-elinux` | ✅ Builds and **runs** (release) | Runs on a virtual device (Weston on Xvfb) in CI, in **both debug and release**. Release needs the from-source engine, since the official standalone one is JIT. See [Sony eLinux](#sony-elinux) |
| `webos` | ✅ App runs in a Wayland window on ARM under emulation; not run on a television | Not a vendor secret: LG's engine exports `FlutterEngineRun` and is an ordinary Custom Embedder API build. It is **ELF 32-bit ARM**, and Google publishes `linux-arm64` but no 32-bit `linux-arm`. See [webOS](#webos-lg) |
| `fuchsia` | ❌ Blocked, same class as webOS | The five build-plumbing walls are fixed: `--build-only` in the fork, `postInstall` bootstrap, submodule handling, the bootstrap's workspace variable, and skipping an unfetchable `googletest` pin. It now clones, bootstraps and stages the app — then dies in `pub get` because the fork's bundled Flutter is **older than Dart 3.4**: `dartvel_example requires SDK version >=3.4.0 <4.0.0, version solving failed`. That is not a Dartvel bug and not a `mix` problem; the embedder's Flutter submodule is simply ancient. Unblocking needs the fork re-pinned to a modern Flutter **and its engine rebuilt from source**, because bootstrap.sh warns the engine and the Flutter pin must stay aligned. See [Fuchsia](#fuchsia) |
| `vscode` | ✅ Builds | `out/src/extension.js`, `out/lib/vscode_api.handlers.js`, `build/web/flutter_bootstrap.js`, `build/web/assets/` |
| `chrome-extension` | ✅ Builds | `build/chrome-extension` (41 MB): MV3 manifest with a `service_worker` background, `index.html`, `main.dart.js`, `background.js`, icons. See [Browser extensions](#browser-extensions) |
| `firefox-extension` | ✅ Builds and **runs** | `build/firefox-extension`: the same bundle with an event-page `background.scripts` manifest — verified to differ from the Chromium one, not copy it |

Flutter has **no desktop cross-compilation**. A Windows desktop build requires
Windows, a Linux desktop build requires Linux, and the Apple targets require
macOS. `dartvel build` skips a target its host cannot build rather than
failing the whole run.

### Linux native bindings

`DVLinuxBindings.register()` binds eight names to libX11, libgtk-3 and GDBus
through `dart:ffi` — no platform channels, per the spec:

| Binding | Backed by |
|---|---|
| `clipboard.copy`, `clipboard.paste` | GTK CLIPBOARD selection |
| `screen.geometry` | X11 display dimensions |
| `notifications.sendLocal` | freedesktop notification service over GDBus |
| `window.setTitle`, `.maximize`, `.minimize`, `.restore` | the app's GTK toplevel |

It is deliberately partial: a binding it cannot implement is left
unregistered, so calling it still throws `DVNativeBridge`'s "not registered"
error rather than returning a plausible lie.

Verified under Xvfb with a session bus:

- A real GTK CLIPBOARD round trip, including a multi-byte UTF-8 value.
- `screen.geometry` reporting the X display's actual size, asserted against
  the geometry the harness started — with a negative control confirming the
  assertion fails when told to expect the wrong number.
- A notification delivered to a real daemon, which answered with the id it
  assigned. D-Bus **activated** the daemon on demand (`dunst` went from 0 to
  1 process during the call), so the message travelled the full bus path.
- Window control driving a real GtkWindow: the title is read back through
  GTK rather than from Dartvel's own state, and the no-window case is
  asserted to report failure rather than pretend.

Those eight are the ones verified by running, not the ones that exist. Linux
registers far more than eight -- `register()` hands the bridge to fifteen or
so sub-modules, so counting the calls in `linux_bindings_ffi.dart` alone
undercounts it badly, and the same trap catches Windows and macOS.

`binding_names.dart` declares **70** names in total. Do not read a per-platform
count off this page: the honest source is the source, and the count moves every
time a binding lands. What is worth recording is the shape of the gap, because
it is not where you would guess.

**Android is second from last, at 10 of 70** -- clipboard both ways, the three
haptics, sharing, deep links, the home widget bridge, and the two kiosk names.
No camera, no location, no biometrics, no runtime permissions, no local
notifications, no sensors, no contacts, no media picker, no NFC, no Bluetooth,
no screen geometry. The APK builds, the app runs, `DV.Platform` reports
`android` correctly, and every one of those calls returns null.

That last part is why this is worth a paragraph rather than a row.
`DVNativeBridge.invoke` returns null for a name nothing registered, which is
the right default -- an unbound capability should degrade rather than throw --
but it means an application asking for the camera on Android cannot tell an
unimplemented binding from a device that said no. The desktop targets are
ahead of the mobile ones, which is the reverse of what a developer coming to
Dartvel to build a phone app will assume.

### Web is the guard on native dependencies

`dartvel_core` now depends on packages that cannot run in a browser: `sqlite3`
(via `dart:ffi`) behind `SqliteDVDatabaseAdapter`, and `dart:io` sockets behind
`SmtpMailProvider`. Both are reached through conditional imports, so a web
build resolves a stand-in that throws with the supported alternative named
rather than pulling the native library in.

Nothing about that is enforced by the type system, so **re-run `flutter build
web` after adding a dependency to `dartvel_core`**. A direct import of a
native-only library compiles fine on every other target and fails only here.
The Wasm dry run is the stronger signal of the two: it fails on `dart:ffi` and
`dart:io` reachability that plain JS compilation can tolerate, so treat a
passing dry run — not just `✓ Built build/web` — as the check.

---

## Toolchain preflight

Before building a target, `dartvel build` checks two things in order:

1. **Can this host build it at all?** If not, the target is skipped with a
   reason. There is no point offering to install Xcode on Linux.
2. **Are the required tools installed?** Missing tools are listed by name.

What happens next depends on where it is running:

| Situation | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Interactive terminal | Lists what is missing and asks before installing |
| CI (`CI=true`, `GITHUB_ACTIONS`, `GITLAB_CI`, `BUILDKITE`, `CIRCLECI`, `TF_BUILD`) | Installs without prompting, so a pipeline cannot hang on a prompt |
| `--auto-install` | Installs without prompting, anywhere |
| `--no-auto-install` | Never installs — wins even in CI, for pre-provisioned images |
| No terminal attached | Treated as declined rather than blocking |

Anything installed during a run is added to the `PATH` handed to child
processes, so a freshly installed embedder is usable by the build that just
installed it.

### What Dartvel will and will not install

Dartvel installs the things it can fetch unattended:

The fork repositories are named `dartvel_*`; the executables inside three of
them keep upstream's own `flutter-*` names, because renaming those would mean
patching every vendor script.

| Tool | Installed via | From |
|---|---|---|
| `flutter-tizen` | `git clone` | `dartvel_tizen` |
| `flutter-elinux` | `git clone` | `dartvel_elinux` |
| `flutter-webos` | `git clone` | `dartvel_webos` |
| the Fuchsia embedder checkout (no binary) | `git clone` | `dartvel_fuchsia` |
| `ares` (webOS CLI) | `npm install -g @webos-tools/cli` |
| `npm` (VS Code extension host) | Manual Node.js/npm install |
| Linux desktop deps (`clang`, `cmake`, `ninja`, `pkg-config`, GTK 3) | `apt-get` |

It deliberately will **not** install licence-gated or multi-gigabyte vendor
SDKs, and only prints instructions for them: **Xcode**, **Visual Studio**,
the **Android SDK**, and **Tizen Studio**. Installing those silently on
someone's machine is not Dartvel's call.

Toolchains Dartvel manages itself live in `~/.dartvel/toolchains/`.

## Embedded and television targets

These are driven by the platform vendor's Flutter embedder, never by plain
`flutter build`. Dartvel maintains a fork of each so it can pin and patch the
embedder against the Flutter version Dartvel ships.

| Target | Fork | Upstream | Vendor |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tizen` | [Danroyal001/dartvel_tizen](https://github.com/Danroyal001/dartvel_tizen) | `flutter-tizen/flutter-tizen` | Samsung |
| `sony-elinux` | [Danroyal001/dartvel_elinux](https://github.com/Danroyal001/dartvel_elinux) | `sony/flutter-elinux` | Sony |
| `webos` | [Danroyal001/dartvel_webos](https://github.com/Danroyal001/dartvel_webos) | `lg-flutter-webos/flutter-webos` | LG |
| `fuchsia` | [Danroyal001/dartvel_fuchsia](https://github.com/Danroyal001/dartvel_fuchsia) | `fuchsia/flutter-embedder` | Fuchsia |
| `vscode` | [Danroyal001/dartvel_vscode](https://github.com/Danroyal001/dartvel_vscode) | `SlowGen/flutter_vscode` | VS Code |

### Fuchsia

**Four Dartvel bugs stood between "never executed" and "builds the bundle",
and each one hid the next.** Recorded because the shape is worth remembering:
every layer failed in a way that looked like the target being unsupported.

1. **Bazel was never installed.** CI piped `curl` into `/usr/local/bin`
   without `sudo` and exited 23, and `|| true` swallowed it. Fuchsia was never
   reached at all, while the run looked like a Fuchsia failure.
2. **The build plan named an executable that does not exist.** It resolved
   `dartvel_fuchsia` on PATH, though the comment directly above the code says
   Fuchsia has no embedder binary — it is a Bazel workspace. The lookup could
   only fail, so the target could only skip. The unit test asserted
   `executable == 'dartvel_fuchsia'`, so it passed on the broken behaviour: it
   checked the plan's shape, never that the thing named could be found.
3. **`$FUCHSIA_EMBEDDER_DIR` was unset.** The script named the exact path
   Dartvel had just cloned the checkout to. Dartvel now sets it, per the rule
   that tools installed during a run must reach child processes.
4. **The architecture default was wrong for this target.** `--arch` defaults to
   arm64, which suits TVs and boards; Fuchsia's embedder ships an x64 prebuilt
   engine only. A plain `dartvel build fuchsia` therefore asked for an engine
   that does not exist without anyone choosing arm64.

A fifth wall is in the fork rather than in Dartvel: `build_flutter_app.sh`
calls `build_and_run_example.sh`, which after building tries to run the app on
a device via `tools/ffx`. CI has no device and no `ffx`. The fork needs a
build-only entry point before this target can produce an inspectable artifact.


Driven by Fuchsia's out-of-tree Flutter embedder
([fuchsia.googlesource.com/flutter-embedder](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/flutter-embedder/)),
forked to [Danroyal001/dartvel_fuchsia](https://github.com/Danroyal001/dartvel_fuchsia)
so it can be pinned and patched like the vendor embedders.

This fork is a different proposition from the other three, and the difference
is worth stating plainly rather than discovering mid-build:

- Upstream calls itself an in-progress, experimental runtime and states it has
  no commit queue. Its most recent commit is from early 2023.
- It is **not a Flutter CLI wrapper.** There is no embedder binary to invoke.
  It is a Bazel workspace, and upstream builds only directories under
  `src/examples` carrying a hand-written `<name>_pkg` target — so upstream has
  no path for an app outside its workspace at all.
- The fork closes that: `src/flutter/defs.bzl` adds the `flutter_application`
  rule upstream's own TODO asks for, and `scripts/build_flutter_app.sh` takes
  the path of any Flutter package, runs `flutter build bundle`, stages the
  assets under `src/apps`, and builds them. `dartvel build fuchsia` calls that
  script with the project path.
- Nothing handed to the embedder is Dartvel-specific. A Dartvel app is an
  ordinary Flutter package, so the same script serves a plain `flutter create`
  app — the fork stays a general embedder rather than becoming a Dartvel one.
- **arm64 needs an engine build.** Upstream committed a 291 MB arm64
  `libflutter_engine.so`, which exceeds GitHub's 100 MB limit and was stripped
  on import; the 59 MB x64 engine survived. Build one with
  `scripts/build_and_copy_engine_artifacts.sh` before targeting arm64.

The fork's history is **not** hash-identical to upstream. Upstream committed
prebuilt engine binaries (`libflutter_engine.so`, ~290 MB each, across several
revisions), and GitHub rejects any file over 100 MB. Git LFS would spend more
than the free quota to carry a 2023 engine Dartvel cannot use, so blobs over
90 MB were stripped from every commit on import — 1.1 GB down to 108 MB. The
repository obtains those artifacts through `scripts/setup_engine.sh` and
`scripts/build_and_copy_engine_artifacts.sh` anyway, which is the supported
route. The fork's README records this.

Host support is Linux only — upstream's README states it cannot be built on
macOS or Windows natively — so `dartvel build fuchsia` skips with that reason
on other hosts rather than failing part-way through.

On the upstream history: the Flutter team handed Flutter-on-Fuchsia
maintenance back to the Fuchsia team and planned to move it out of the engine
into this custom embedder — see
[Flutter-on-Fuchsia Velocity](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/contribute/roadmap/2021/flutter_on_fuchsia_velocity).
Fuchsia code is still touched in the engine as recently as the 3.44.0 release
notes, so this reads as an ownership handover that stalled rather than a clean
removal. Treat any stronger claim as unverified.

### Building the engine: four attempts, and where it stops

Unblocking Fuchsia needs the fork re-pinned to a modern Flutter, and
`bootstrap.sh` requires the engine and the Flutter pin stay aligned, so the
engine has to be rebuilt. Flutter publishes **no Fuchsia embedder artifact at
any revision** — checked against `flutter_infra_release` for the 3.44.5 engine
hash, where `linux-x64/artifacts.zip` is 200 and every Fuchsia path is 404 —
so there is nothing to download instead.

`dartvel engine plan --os fuchsia` describes that build now, and four of them
have run. Each moved the failure, and the last two are the same failure:

| Attempt | gn arguments | Where it stopped |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `--target-os fuchsia --fuchsia-cpu x64 --runtime-mode release` | Whole tree compiled; link failed on every embedder symbol with `R_X86_64_PC32 … recompile with -fPIC` |
| 2 | added `--embedder-for-target` | Identical |
| 3 | `--unopt`, debug, output `fuchsia_debug_unopt_x64` | **Embedder symbols link.** Fails later on `R_X86_64_TPOFF32 against dart::OSThread::current_vm_thread_ cannot be used with -shared` |
| 4 | dropped `--no-prebuilt-dart-sdk`, matching the fork's script exactly | Identical to 3 |

The last is a thread-local compiled for an executable being linked into a
shared library: the Dart VM's `current_vm_thread_` under a local-exec TLS
model. The Linux embedder library links today, so the Linux path configures a
TLS model that works with `-shared` and the Fuchsia path does not.

Two things were read rather than guessed, after guessing cost the first three
builds. `tools/gn` defines `--fuchsia` as a plain alias for `--target-os
fuchsia`, so that spelling was never the difference. The rest of the arguments
come from the fork's own `build_and_copy_engine_artifacts.sh`, which is the
only known-working invocation of this build.

**Status: the engine does not build at 3.44.5, and that is where this stops.**
Attempt 4 matches the fork's invocation exactly and fails, so this is not a
missing flag. The fork's committed engine is from 2023, Flutter handed
Flutter-on-Fuchsia maintenance back to the Fuchsia team, and nothing indicates
this build has been run since. Treat a Fuchsia embedder library as an
unsupported configuration of a modern engine until someone shows otherwise —
the next real step is finding which Flutter version last built one, not
another flag.

## Extension-host targets

Extension-host targets compile Flutter into the host's webview/runtime shape
instead of using plain `flutter build web`.

### VS Code

`dartvel build vscode` follows the `flutter_vscode` flow:

1. Generate Dartvel routes/client/backend artifacts.
2. Run `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` so annotated
   VS Code controller APIs emit current bindings.
3. Run `dart run flutter_vscode:generate_vscode_extension` to create/update
   the VS Code extension scaffold, typed controller bindings, and webview
   helper wiring.
4. Run `flutter pub get`.
5. Run `npm install`.
6. Run `npm run compile`.

The target requires Node.js/npm, a project dependency on `flutter_vscode`, and
`build_runner` in `dev_dependencies`. `dartvel build vscode` validates the
pubspec dependencies before running the scaffold generator. `dartvel doctor
--target vscode` reports whether npm is available.

After the compile step, Dartvel validates the artifact shape and freshness so a
zero exit code without current-build output cannot be reported as success.
Verified evidence from the disposable `examples/basic_app` copy:

- `dart run dartvel_cli:dartvel build vscode --no-auto-install`
- Extension host output: `out/src/extension.js`,
  `out/lib/vscode_api.handlers.js`, and `out/src/vscode_invoke.js`.
- Flutter webview bundle output: `build/web/flutter_bootstrap.js`,
  `build/web/main.dart.js`, and `build/web/assets/`.
- Generated extension metadata: `package.json` produced by the Dartvel fork's
  scaffold flow.

#### Running the extension, and the two bugs it found

`firefox-extension` had only ever been built. Loading it turned up two faults
that a Chromium-only check could not see, and neither announced itself.

**The generated CSP forbade the renderer.** Both extension targets shipped
`script-src 'self'; object-src 'self'`. Flutter's web renderer compiles
WebAssembly, which MV3 blocks without `'wasm-unsafe-eval'`.

**The build fetched CanvasKit from a CDN.** Without `--no-web-resources-cdn`,
Flutter loads it from `https://www.gstatic.com` at run time, and an extension
page may not:

```
TypeError: error loading dynamically imported module: https://www.gstatic.com/...
```

That one is wrong independently of any CSP — an extension that downloads its
renderer does not work offline, and ships a third-party fetch for a store to
ask about. The build arguments moved into `browserExtensionBuildArguments`
because they had been inline in the build command where nothing could check
them.

**And `/index.html` was not a route.** An extension opens its page at
`moz-extension://<uuid>/index.html`, so the router rendered its own 404. Anyone
landing on a static host's file directly hits the same path; the generated
redirect now resolves it.

**None of this was visible in a screenshot.** Four captures of a white page
said nothing, because every DOM check passed: the scripts loaded,
`window._flutter` was defined, WebAssembly compiled, CanvasKit fetched 200.
The error existed only in the page's console, which is why the job captures it
now. Then the fixed build produced a *rendered* 404 that passed the colour
check — the second time in this session a capture check has waved through a
page that was drawn and wrong. The job reads the page's text as well.

`tool/ci/firefox_shot.py` drives Firefox through Marionette rather than using
`firefox --screenshot`, which fires on the load event, before a Flutter
application has started. Reaching a `moz-extension://` URL needs the chrome
context and `-remote-allow-system-access`; release Firefox will not install an
unsigned add-on at all, so the job uses Developer Edition and a zipped XPI —
an unpacked directory in a profile is ignored silently.

### Tizen (Samsung)

**Verified Flutter: 3.44.4 / Dart 3.12.2** — clears Dartvel's dependency floor.

A complete, signed TPK is produced end to end:

```
✓ Built build/tizen/tpk/com.example.dartvel_example-1.0.0.tpk (9.3MB)
```

It contains `lib/libapp.so`, `lib/libflutter_engine.so`,
`lib/libflutter_tizen_tv.so`, `res/icudtl.dat` and `res/flutter_assets/` — a
runnable Flutter application.

> **This required a fix in the Dartvel fork.** A native build first produced a
> 15KB TPK holding only the compiled runner, an icon and the manifest, with
> `lib/` and `res/` empty: a package that installs and does nothing. The
> payload was staged correctly in `tizen/flutter/ephemeral/{lib,res}`, and
> `tizen package -e <ephemeralDir>` is meant to inject it — but on current
> Tizen SDK CLI versions (10.x) that call reports success while producing a
> TPK without it. The fork now copies the payload into the app root before
> building, so it is part of the build rather than a post-hoc injection.
> This is exactly the class of problem the forks exist to absorb.

Getting that far required, beyond the embedder:

1. **A Tizen platform scaffold.** `dartvel build tizen` needs a `tizen/`
   directory the way Android builds need `android/`. Generate the native one:
   ```bash
   flutter-tizen create --platforms tizen --tizen-language cpp .
   ```
   Without it the build stops at `This project is not configured for Tizen`.
   The default scaffold is C#/.NET; `--tizen-language cpp` matches the native
   GCC toolchain below.

2. **Tizen SDK packages** — the base SDK is not enough:
   ```bash
   <tizen-studio>/package-manager/package-manager-cli.bin install \
     NativeCLI NativeToolchain-Gcc-9.2 IOT-Headed-6.0-NativeAppDevelopment-CLI
   ```
   `NativeCLI` pulls in `tizen-core`, which provides the `tz` tool. flutter-tizen
   packages TPKs through `tz` with no fallback, so the SDK must be recent enough
   to ship it.

3. **A signing certificate.** Release packaging fails with
   `No certificate profile found` until one exists:
   ```bash
   tizen certificate -a Dartvel -p <password> -c KR -s Seoul -ct Seoul \
     -o Dartvel -u Dev -e dev@example.com -n dartvel-author
   tizen security-profiles add -n DartvelProfile \
     -a ~/tizen-studio-data/keystore/author/author.p12 -p <password>
   ```

**Ubuntu 24.04 notes.** Tizen Studio's package manager needs `python3.8`,
which 24.04 does not ship (available from the deadsnakes PPA). Its bundled
LLVM 10 links against `libtinfo.so.5`; symlinking `libtinfo.so.6` is not
enough because the ncurses 5 ABI symbols are genuinely absent — install the
real `libtinfo5` package.

### The three blocked targets share a shape, not a cause

## Runtime verification

`.github/workflows/runtime-verification.yml` builds each target, **runs** it,
and captures what it drew. Every image below is an artifact of that workflow,
and a green job with no image is not a pass — the eLinux job went green with no
screenshot on its first run, which is exactly the false positive the images
exist to catch.

| Target | Runs | What the capture shows |

What running found that building could not:

- **The web build had been broken** since the Rust HTTP transport landed —
  `dart:ffi` is not available on web and the export was unconditional. No CI job
  built web, so nothing noticed.
- **The eLinux release bundle cannot start.** See the correction below.
- **The terminal embedder panicked** with a capacity overflow when the terminal
  had no dimensions, before drawing anything.
- **Software GL is required** on a runner. Without it the eLinux client's EGL
  falls through to ZINK, fails `vkCreateInstance` with
  `VK_ERROR_INCOMPATIBLE_DRIVER`, and never gets a context — which reads as an
  embedder fault and is not one.

Not yet covered: Android, Windows, macOS, iOS and tvOS. Each needs a different
runner or emulator, and none has been run.

**Release now runs, and the engine question is settled.** The from-source
release engine built by `engine-build.yml` does run an AOT bundle: the
runtime-verification workflow assembles one — desktop `libapp.so`, the release
engine, Sony's embedder — and it renders on the virtual device with no DEBUG
banner and the production backend, where the debug run shows both.

That had to be settled by running it. Inspecting the binary was inconclusive:
the `Not running in AOT mode` string is present in the from-source release
build as well as in the official one, so the string check that first identified
the official engine as JIT would have given the wrong answer here. The runtime
error was the real evidence; the string was a coincidence that happened to
point the same way.

**Correction, established by running the thing rather than inspecting it: the
official standalone engine is the JIT build, not the release build.** This file
previously said the opposite, inferred from its size — 41.7 MB against Sony's
release 42.6 MB — and that inference was wrong. The binary settles it: it
contains the strings `kernel_blob.bin` and `Not running in AOT mode but could
not resolve the kernel binary`, which a release engine has no use for.

The eLinux release bundle assembled from it therefore **cannot start**. It
pairs an AOT `libapp.so` with an engine that only runs kernel, and the
application dies during `FlutterEngineInitialize` with exactly that message.
The structural verification recorded below — snapshot symbols present, no GTK
dependencies — was true and insufficient: nothing about inspecting an artifact
can catch a mode mismatch between two files that are each individually correct.

That is the whole argument for running rather than building, and it took one
run to demonstrate.

What follows from it:

- **eLinux debug** is what the official artifact supports today, with
  `kernel_blob.bin` rather than `libapp.so`.
- **eLinux release** needs a release engine built from source, which is what
  `engine-build.yml` is for.

**The engine build works, and the modes Google does not publish are now
obtainable.** `.github/workflows/engine-build.yml` builds the Flutter engine
from source on a GitHub runner and splits the result into chunks that clear
GitHub's 100 MB file limit, so it travels back without Git LFS. Verified for
`profile` at 3.44.5:

```
libflutter_engine.so  54.2 MB, exports FlutterEngineRun, carries the
                      observatory and timeline strings a release build does not
gen_snapshot          6.1 MB
flutter_embedder.h
```

Against the official release engine at 41.7 MB, so it is a genuinely different
build rather than the same artifact under another name. The chunks were rejoined
in the development Codespace and the whole-artifact sha256 verified.

Four attempts, all failing on the same thing: where gclient wants its root.
flutter/flutter contains **both** `engine/src/build` and `engine/src/flutter`,
and `DEPS` at its root uses gclient-root-relative paths — so the repository root
*is* the gclient root, and no subdirectory arrangement satisfies both. That is
readable from `DEPS` and was worth reading before the first attempt rather than
after the third.

**The eLinux release path no longer goes through `flutter-elinux` at all.** A
desktop release build already produces every piece an eLinux release bundle
needs — `data/flutter_assets`, `data/icudtl.dat` and an AOT `lib/libapp.so` for
the same architecture — and differs only in which executable and which engine
library sit beside them. Swapping those two is the whole job, so neither an
engine build nor the fifteen-version-stale tool is required.

Assembled and inspected from the example app's release build plus the
CI-produced Sony artifacts:

```
flutter-client            Sony's Wayland embedder, 0 GTK/GDK deps
lib/libflutter_engine.so  official engine, exports FlutterEngineRun
lib/libapp.so             AOT, carries _kDartVmSnapshotData and
                          _kDartIsolateSnapshotInstructions
data/flutter_assets/      from the desktop build
data/icudtl.dat
```

48 MB. **It has not been run** — that needs an eLinux device with Wayland or
DRM, which this host is not. Assembled and structurally verified is a weaker
claim than working, and is the one being made.

**Terminal builds and native assets do not currently compose, and that is
Flutter's constraint rather than Dartvel's.** `dartvel-cli-flt` assembles a bundle
from `flutter build bundle`, which is the only Flutter command that emits an
asset bundle without also building a GUI shell. On Linux, a project with native
assets — which every Dartvel project has, because the Rust runtime is one —
fails there with:

```
Target dart_build failed: Could not read compiler configurations for build
hooks, expected build/flutter_assets/linux/x64/debug/CMakeCache.txt to exist.
```

That path cannot exist. Flutter derives the native-asset compiler
configuration from a CMake cache under the *bundle output directory*, and
`flutter build bundle` never runs CMake — only the desktop build does, and it
writes its cache under `build/linux/x64/<mode>/` instead. So the two are
mutually exclusive as things stand.

The bundle assembly itself is proven: `dartvel-cli-flt build` against the flt
fork's own `sample_app`, which has no native assets, produces a bundle that
starts and runs. What is unproven is a *Dartvel* application in a terminal,
and this is why.

Two ways out, neither yet taken. A desktop build could be run purely to produce
the assets, with its GUI binary discarded — which honours the rule that a
`-cli` build *bundles* no GUI, since nothing GUI is shipped, at the cost of
building one to throw away. Or `flutter assemble` could be driven directly with
the native-asset configuration supplied rather than inferred, which is the
cleaner answer and the larger one.

**What actually blocks webOS, measured rather than assumed.** This file has
said at various times that webOS needs a Dart 3.12 embedder, and that its
engine is a vendor build only LG can produce. The second is wrong and the first
is downstream of something more specific.

LG's `libflutter_engine.so` was downloaded and inspected. It exports
`FlutterEngineRun`: it is an ordinary Custom Embedder API engine, not a
proprietary one. LG's runner template is even derived from Sony's — the file
carries "Copyright 2021 Sony Corporation" — so webOS Flutter is the same
architecture as eLinux, which already works.

The binary is **ELF 32-bit ARM**. Google publishes `linux-x64` and
`linux-arm64` embedder engines and **no 32-bit `linux-arm`** — that URL returns
404 where the arm64 one returns 200. webOS televisions run a 32-bit ARM
userland, so there is no published engine to link against, and that is the
whole of the blocker.

It follows that webOS needs the same treatment eLinux needed: an engine built
from source, for `linux_release_arm`. That is a build to run, not a vendor to
wait for — but "accepts `arm`" was, for a week, only true of the dropdown.

**Three things had to be fixed before that build could compile, and the first
one was mine.** `engine-build.yml` took an `arch` input, put it in the artifact
filename, and ran `et build -c host_<mode>` regardless. A request for 32-bit
ARM produced an x86-64 engine, uploaded it as `engine-arm-release`, and
reported success — the workflow asserted a name rather than a behaviour, which
is the defect class this repository has a rule about. `dartvel engine verify`
now reads the ELF header of what was built and fails the job before the
upload; run against that artifact it says `libflutter_engine.so is x64,
expected arm32`.

The other two are in the engine, and both are the same shape: Linux/arm is a
configuration the stock build does not cover.

* `build/config/sysroot.gni` assigns a default sysroot for x64, arm64 and
  riscv64 and nothing else, so gn stops at `Undefined identifier: sysroot`.
  The sysroot exists — `sysroots.json` lists `bullseye_armhf` and
  `install-sysroot.py` already translates `--arch=arm` to it — so it only has
  to be named, via `--target-sysroot`, as an absolute path (gn resolves a
  relative one against the output directory).
* `build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn` emits `-march`, `-mfloat-abi`, `-mfpu` and
  `-mthumb` for `current_cpu == "arm"` while its Linux target-triple block
  covers arm64 only, so clang is handed ARM flags and still targets the host:
  `unsupported option '-mfloat-abi=' for target 'x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu'`.
  The answer is `build/toolchain/custom`, which takes a toolchain, a sysroot
  and a triple and whose own comment gives `arm-linux-gnueabihf` as the
  example. Its `${triple}-ar`/`-readelf`/`-nm`/`-strip` are assembled as links
  to the engine's own target-agnostic LLVM tools.

The float ABI is set to `hard` explicitly. `arm.gni` defaults armv7 to
`softfp`, a different calling convention from the armhf sysroot's; the two
link without complaint and pass floats in the wrong registers, so nothing
would fail until a television ran it.

**It builds.** `engine-build.yml` produced a 32-bit ARM release engine on
2026-08-26 from Flutter 3.44.5, and the artifact was inspected rather than
inferred from a green check:

```
libflutter_engine.so   ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, ARM, EABI5
gen_snapshot           ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64
Tag_CPU_arch: v7   Tag_FP_arch: VFPv3-D16   Tag_ABI_VFP_args: VFP registers
```

`gen_snapshot` being x86-64 is correct and not an oversight: it runs on the
builder and emits code for the target, so a cross build produces a host
snapshotter beside a target engine. `Tag_ABI_VFP_args: VFP registers` is the
hard-float ABI, which is what makes the `arm_float_abi` argument above
load-bearing rather than cosmetic. `nm -D` finds `FlutterEngineRun` and its
neighbours, so it is a Custom Embedder API engine of the same shape as LG's.

**Two more walls fell after the ones above, and the second undid the first.**
The link stage wanted `libclang_rt.builtins.a`, then `-lc++` and `-lunwind`,
and each looked like a separate missing package — an armhf libgcc was
substituted for the builtins, and a two-pass ninja staged libc++ into the
toolchain. Both were solving a problem that did not exist. clang resolves all
three by triple, and the directory it ships is
`armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf`; the requested `arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf`
does not exist, so nothing inside it did either. One string. The workarounds
were deleted and the triple is now asserted against clang's own runtime
directories before a build starts, so a wrong one fails in two seconds with
the sixteen that do exist printed.

The last of them was smaller: a bare `ninja` builds the default target group,
which for a Linux cross build is the GTK shell. It linked
`libflutter_linux_gtk.so`, never touched `libflutter_engine.so`, and reported
success. The build names the artifacts it collects now.

**The package assembles.** `runtime-verification.yml` builds one in CI from
the ARM engine, and the artifact was inspected rather than inferred:

```
com.dartvel.example/appinfo.json          type: native, com.dartvel.example, 1.0.0
com.dartvel.example/lib/libflutter_engine.so   ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, ARM, EABI5
com.dartvel.example/lib/libapp.so              ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, ARM, EABI5
com.dartvel.example/data/flutter_assets/…
com.dartvel.example/data/icudtl.dat
```

Getting `libapp.so` there took three wrong turns worth recording, because each
looked like the obvious move:

* `flutter build bundle --release` emits no `kernel_blob.bin`. A release bundle
  is already AOT for the host, so there is nothing for `gen_snapshot` to read.
* The debug `kernel_blob.bin` holds only the application's code. The platform
  is supplied separately by the debug engine at run time, so an AOT compiler
  has no `dart:core` to resolve against and aborts with *"Unable to use class
  Library:'dart:core' … which is not loaded yet"*.
* The kernel therefore has to be compiled against the AOT platform, by the
  frontend server Flutter ships — under `dartaotruntime`, since
  `frontend_server_aot.dart.snapshot` is an AOT snapshot and refuses the JIT
  runtime. The patched SDK is kernel and architecture-independent, which is
  why the host's copy serves a target Flutter has no toolchain for.

**The app renders on ARM.** `qemu-user` executes 32-bit ARM binaries on an
x86-64 machine, so the question "does the engine work" does not need a
television or an ARM runner — only the question "does LG's window and input
stack work" does. [`tool/webos/render_probe.c`](../tool/webos/render_probe.c)
starts the engine with the software renderer, sends one window-metrics event
and photographs what it draws. Run against the artifacts the `webos` job
builds, it produces the Dartvel example's own page — the showcase heading, its
About and Pricing links, and the platform cards — at **800x480, 1,288 colours,
36.75% dominant**. The `webos` job runs it on every push and uploads the frame.

It photographs the *settled* frame rather than the first one. The first frame
is the shell alone, because a page's content arrives over a deferred load, so
stopping there produced an app bar above an empty body — 120 colours, 90.83%
of them one background — and called it a rendered application. That is the
difference between checking the engine and checking the app.

The frame is checked with `dartvel capture verify` rather than `test -s`,
because a crash before the first frame leaves a buffer that is one colour and
one colour passes every check that only stats the file. Note what that check
did *not* catch on its own: an app bar over an empty body is not one colour,
and it passed.

Two failures on the way there both read as a broken engine and were both a
missing argument, so they are written down rather than left to be
rediscovered. `FlutterRendererConfig` is a **union with no `struct_size`**; a
copy of it made by eye as a struct with one returns `kInvalidArguments`. And a
release engine has **no interpreter**, so the AOT snapshot has to be handed
over through `FlutterEngineCreateAOTData` — without it the engine stops at
*"VM snapshot invalid and could not be inferred from settings"*.

**It also runs in a window.** `webos-window.yml` cross-compiles **Sony's own
Wayland client** for armhf — webOS's runner template is Sony's, so this is the
binary a television launches rather than a stand-in written for the test — and
runs it under `qemu-arm-static` against Weston on Xvfb, the same virtual device
the `sony-elinux` job uses. The app fills the compositor's 1280x720 output:
heading, nav links, the platform cards and the State & Signals section.

That covers the window, the surface and the GL path (llvmpipe, since a runner
has no GPU). What the offscreen render could not reach, this does.

**The gate is the runner, not the picture.** The first version of that job went
green on a photograph of Weston's *empty desktop*, because the runner had died
at once — the engine sits in the bundle's `lib/` and nothing told the loader to
look there. A bare compositor is a textured grey with a clock in the corner: it
has plenty of colours and no dominant one, so it satisfies every check
`capture verify` makes. That verifier exists to refuse a blank screen and it
did that correctly; a compositor with no client on it is not blank, and no
tightening of a colour check would have caught it. The job now requires the
runner to still be alive when the photograph is taken and its log to be free of
loader and startup failures.

**What is still not established.** LG's own surface manager and its
remote-control input. Weston is a real compositor but it is not LSM, and
nothing here presses a button on a remote. Settling that needs
`ares-install` against a real set.

**LG's emulator cannot stand in for one, and this is checked rather than
assumed.** The webOS TV emulator ships as a VirtualBox appliance, and
VirtualBox is a virtualiser rather than an emulator: it runs x86 guests on x86
hosts and cannot execute an ARM guest at all. webOS OSE's QEMU emulator is
explicit about the same limit — *"the emulator only supports the x86 (x86_64)
machine architecture"*, built with `--target-list=i386-softmmu`. Neither would
load the ARM engine this target is built around.

So the emulator is not a cheaper approximation of a television, it is a
different question. Using it would first require an **x86 webOS engine**,
which is a second engine build, and what it would then exercise is LG's window
and input stack — the part that is actually open — while testing none of the
ARM work. Worth doing for that reason and not for the obvious one; a real set
tests both at once.

**webOS was checked the same way and is not out of the group.** LG publishes
artifacts at `lg-flutter-webos/artifacts`, and the newest release is recent —
`c6f67dede3-webos26-1`, 2026-06-29 — which looks encouraging and is not. That
tag's Flutter commit `c6f67dede3` resolves to **Flutter 3.38.10** (tagged, Feb
2026), whose Dart is 3.10.9 and below Dartvel's floor. It is new artifacts for
an old Flutter.

The difference from Sony matters: Sony's embedder links the *official* engine,
so Google publishing one for our revision was enough. LG's is a webOS platform
engine that only LG builds, so there is no official artifact to substitute and
no public recipe to reproduce it. webOS stays blocked on a vendor build, and
that is a genuinely different position from eLinux.

**Sony eLinux is out of this group too, and for the same reason.** The premise
was that it needed a Flutter engine built from source. It does not, and the
check cost minutes:

- Sony's `elinux-x64-release.zip` is the **official engine** at their pinned
  revision, plus their own embedder libraries, plus `gen_snapshot`. Both
  engines were downloaded and compared — they differ only in the revision
  string they carry. Sony does not patch the engine; they build an embedder on
  the stable Custom Embedder API above it.
- Google publishes, for Dartvel's exact engine, `linux-x64` and `linux-arm64`
  embedder libraries plus `artifacts.zip` (`gen_snapshot`, `icudtl.dat`,
  `impellerc`). All seven URLs return 200.
- Sony's embedder source **compiles and links against that engine**, verified
  by the `Embedder artifacts` workflow: `flutter-client` (Wayland),
  `flutter-drm-gbm-backend` and `flutter-drm-eglstream-backend` all build, and
  the resulting ELF binaries carry `NEEDED libflutter_engine.so` and import
  `FlutterEngine` symbols. Sony's newest published build is a year older than
  this engine, so that compatibility was the real unknown and is now answered.

What is left for the target is not an engine, and it is not plumbing either —
calling it that was wrong. Two things stand in the way, and they are different
sizes:

- **Debug and profile still need an engine build.** Google publishes exactly
  one standalone `libflutter_engine.so` per revision and it is the **release**
  build: 41.7 MB, against Sony's release 42.6 MB, profile 52.5 MB and debug
  381 MB, all three of which have distinct hashes. The per-mode directories
  carry `linux-{arch}-flutter-gtk.zip`, where the engine is statically linked
  into the GTK embedder and cannot be reused. `.github/workflows/engine-build.yml`
  builds the missing modes.
- **`flutter-elinux`, the tool, is pinned to Flutter 3.29.3**, and upstream has
  not committed since 2025-07-09. Its classes subclass `flutter_tools`
  internals, so moving it to 3.44.5 is a port across fifteen minor versions
  rather than a version bump. That is now the binding constraint for
  `dartvel build sony-elinux`, and it is the larger of the two.

There is a way around the second that is worth weighing before paying for it:
an eLinux application is the embedder executable, `libflutter_engine.so`, the
app's AOT `app.so`, `icudtl.dat` and the asset bundle. Every one of those can be
produced by stock Flutter 3.44.5 plus the artifacts above — `flutter build
bundle` and `gen_snapshot` — which would let Dartvel assemble the bundle
directly and never invoke `flutter-elinux` at all.

The terminal embedder was in this group and is not any more. `dartvel_cli_flt`
pinned Flutter 3.38.5, below Dartvel's floor — but the prebuilt
`linux-x64-embedder` artifact **is** published for Dartvel's engine, so the
re-pin needed four source changes rather than an engine build, and the fork now
compiles against 3.44.5. Worth stating plainly because it is the counterexample:
being behind the floor does not by itself mean an engine build, and the way to
tell is to check whether the artifact exists rather than to assume.

webOS, Sony eLinux and Fuchsia are all blocked by an embedder shipping a Dart
older than Dartvel needs. The distances are very different, and conflating them
would send the work in the wrong direction:

| Target | Embedder's Dart | Short by | Cheapest unblock |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| webOS | 3.10.9 | 1.1 against `dartvel_mix`'s 3.12 floor | Engine rebuild, or lower our own fork's pin |
| Sony eLinux | 3.7.2 | Well short of `dartvel_mix` | Engine rebuild |
| Fuchsia | **older than 3.4** | Short of Dartvel's own example, before the UI layer is reached | Re-pin the fork's Flutter **and rebuild its engine** |

**webOS changed shape once `dartvel_mix` existed, and got further away
rather than closer.** This section previously asked whether pub's `mix 2.1.0`
really needed Dart 3.11 or was merely conservative, because an older published
`mix` would have cleared webOS's 3.10.9 by a hair. That question is now
retired: `dartvel_flutter` does not depend on pub's `mix` at all. It depends on
`dartvel_mix`, which pins Dart 3.12 to stay level with every other Dartvel
fork — so the gap widened from 0.0.1 to 1.1.

The useful part is that **the floor is now a Dartvel decision rather than an
upstream fact.** Nobody has to pin a pre-release UI dependency for the whole
framework to move it. There are two levers, and they are both ours:

1. **Rebuild the webOS engine** against a Flutter whose Dart clears 3.12. This
   is the same work Sony eLinux needs, and it is the one that leaves the fork
   pinned where the rest of the project is.
2. **Lower `dartvel_mix`'s floor**, if nothing in it genuinely requires 3.12.
   Cheap if true, but it pulls one fork off the shared pin, and the whole point
   of the fork table is that the pins are tracked together.

Lever 1 is the right default. Lever 2 is worth measuring before committing to
an engine build, because the measurement is an afternoon and the engine build
is not — but it should not be taken merely because it is cheaper.

Fuchsia gets no benefit from any of that. Its Flutter cannot run Dartvel's own
example, so it needs the re-pin and engine build regardless of what `mix`
requires.

### Sony eLinux

**Verified Flutter: 3.29.3 / Dart 3.7.2 — target is blocked.**

The embedder installs and runs, and the engine artifacts download fine
(`elinux-x64-{debug,profile,release}.zip` at engine `cf56914b32`, all HTTP
200). The build then fails at dependency resolution:

```
The current Dart SDK version is 3.7.2.
Because every version of dartvel_shelf from path depends on
code_assets >=0.19.1 which requires SDK version >=3.9.0-21.0.dev <4.0.0,
dartvel_shelf from path is forbidden.
```

`dartvel_shelf` compiles the Rust backend through a Dart native-asset build
hook, which requires `code_assets ^0.19.7` and therefore **Dart ≥ 3.9.0**.
The newest Flutter the eLinux embedder supports ships Dart 3.7.2.

This is worth stating precisely, because it is easy to get wrong: the blocker
is **Dartvel's own dependency floor meeting the embedder's Flutter ceiling**,
not a missing engine. Sony's newest published engine is `ef0cd00091`
(2025-07-25); the 3.44.5 engine `83675ed276` returns HTTP 404. So the ceiling
is real, but the floor is what the build actually hits first.

Unblocking it requires an eLinux Flutter engine built for a Dart ≥ 3.12
release. That is a from-source engine build rather than a version-pin bump —
but it is **our** build to do, not something to wait on Sony for. The whole
reason `dartvel_elinux` is a fork is that it can be pinned and patched ahead of
upstream; inheriting Sony's Flutter pin is a choice this fork has not yet
un-made, not a limit the vendor imposes on us.

### webOS (LG)

**Verified Flutter: 3.38.10 / Dart 3.10.9 — target is blocked.**

The embedder and the `ares` CLI both install cleanly through auto-install, and
`dartvel build webos` now generates the `webos/` scaffold itself rather than
requiring the manual step Tizen needs. The scaffold is written — seven files,
`CMakeLists.txt`, `runner/main.cc`, `meta/appinfo.json` and the rest — and then
the embedder's own dependency resolution refuses the project:

```
The current Dart SDK version is 3.10.9.

Because every version of dartvel_flutter from path depends on mix >=2.0.0 which
requires SDK version >=3.11.0 <4.0.0, dartvel_flutter from path is forbidden.
```

**This is a floor, and it is not the floor the target was previously measured
against.** The earlier note reasoned that Flutter 3.38.10 "should clear the
Dart ≥ 3.9 floor" — true, and irrelevant. That 3.9 floor is `code_assets`, what
`dartvel_shelf`'s build hook needs. The binding constraint is higher and comes
from the UI layer: `dartvel_flutter` depends on `mix: ^2.0.0`, which requires
Dart ≥ 3.11.0. The embedder ships 3.10.9, so **no Dartvel application can build
for webOS at all** — this fails before any webOS engine or `ares` packaging
question is reached.

Like Sony eLinux, a version-pin bump alone cannot fix it. Unlike Sony eLinux,
the wall is the Dart SDK the embedder bundles rather than a missing prebuilt
engine artifact.

The error above was captured against pub's `mix` and its 3.11 floor. Dartvel
now depends on `dartvel_mix` at 3.12, so the same resolution fails the same way
with a larger number; the shape of the failure is unchanged.

**This is not a wait-on-LG blocker.** `dartvel_webos` is a fork precisely so it
does not have to ship whatever Flutter LG last pinned; the fork currently
inherits that pin, which is a thing to change rather than a constraint to
report. Unblocking means moving the fork to a Flutter whose Dart clears 3.12
and building the webOS engine from source for it. Whether an LG-published
engine happens to exist for such a version is a convenience, not the gate.

### tvOS

Apple publishes no tvOS Flutter embedder. The target rides the community
[`fluttertv/flutter-tvos`](https://github.com/fluttertv/flutter-tvos) CLI,
forked as [`dartvel_tvos`](https://github.com/Danroyal001/dartvel_tvos).

**Upstream pins Flutter 3.44.8** (revision `058e0af2c2b57e369d905a03ac9748b0ebf543c6`)
with origin-signed tvOS engine artifacts `v1.0.2-flutter3.44.8`. Dartvel targets
3.44.5, so the embedder is three patches **ahead** — the same minor, and clear of
both walls the other forks hit: no missing prebuilt engine as on Sony eLinux, and
no Dart 3.9 floor problem. The embedder carries its own Flutter SDK, so a tvOS
build compiles against 3.44.8 rather than the 3.44.5 pinned elsewhere.

The build command is `flutter-tvos build tvos`, **not** `flutter build ios`.
Device builds are AOT and require a configured Xcode signing team;
`--simulator --debug` is the only unsigned path, which is what CI can use.

**Not yet demonstrated, but further along than that sounds.** On a macOS
runner the fork clones, bootstraps, and precaches its own engine cleanly —
all six tvOS engine variants (`tvos-debug-sim-arm64` through
`tvos-host-release`) fetch in about 15 seconds, confirming the origin-signed
artifacts for 3.44.8 genuinely exist. `flutter-tvos doctor` then reports
Flutter 3.44.8 from the fork's own checkout.

The build stops at the next wall:

```
Running build hooks...This project is not configured for tvOS.
To fix this problem, create a new project by running `flutter-tvos create <app-dir>`.
```

`examples/dartvel_example` has no `tvos/` directory, exactly as it has no
`tizen/`. Rather than making that a manual prerequisite the way Tizen's is
(step 1 below), `dartvel build` now generates a missing platform scaffold
through the embedder's own `create` (`d0874755`, covering tizen, sony-elinux,
webos and tvos). That path has not been executed on a runner yet.

**Any earlier "passing" tvOS build was not one.** Until `b25b025a` the CLI
mapped `tvos` onto the iOS toolchain and ran `flutter build ios --no-codesign`,
so the matrix reported a green tvOS job for an iPhone app.

### Browser extensions

`chrome-extension` and `firefox-extension` are not embedder targets. They are
Flutter web output plus a generated manifest and background script, so any host
that can build web can build them. Two build flags are load-bearing rather than
stylistic: `--csp`, because manifest V3 forbids `eval`, and
`--pwa-strategy=none`, because Flutter's service worker fights the extension's
own — the assembler also deletes `flutter_service_worker.js` from the bundle if
it appears, since two service workers contend over fetch handling.

The two manifests genuinely differ, and must: Chromium runs a manifest V3
`service_worker`, while Firefox runs an event page and refuses to load a
manifest declaring `service_worker`.

```jsonc
// chrome-extension/manifest.json     // firefox-extension/manifest.json
"background": {                       "background": {
  "service_worker": "background.js",    "scripts": ["background.js"]
  "type": "module"                    }
}
```

Verified 2026-08-15 against `examples/dartvel_example`: both bundles build,
carry all four artifacts a browser needs to load them unpacked
(`index.html`, `main.dart.js`, `manifest.json`, `background.js`), share one CSP
with no `unsafe-eval` or `unsafe-inline`, and drop Flutter's service worker.

Two things applications should know. The generated background script resolves
`globalThis.browser ?? globalThis.chrome` rather than being emitted per target,
so one script serves both. And `browser_specific_settings.gecko.id` is only
emitted when `dartvel.extension.geckoId` is set in `pubspec.yaml` — fine for a
temporary Firefox install, required before distribution.

## CI for hosts you do not have

`.github/workflows/platform-build-matrix.yml` builds `windows`, `macos`, `ios`,
and `tvos` on GitHub-hosted runners, which is the only place they can honestly
be verified from a Linux machine.

It is **manually triggered** (`workflow_dispatch`) on purpose. This repository
is private, so runner minutes bill against the account quota with a **2×
multiplier on Windows and 10× on macOS**. Running it on every push would be
expensive and rarely more informative than running it deliberately.

The workflow installs `cbindgen` explicitly. `dartvel_shelf`'s build hook skips
Rust compilation when `cargo` is missing, but treats a missing `cbindgen` as a
hard error — and hosted runners ship cargo without cbindgen. It also asserts an
artifact exists rather than trusting the build command's exit code.

### Why a hang is the expensive failure

A build that *fails* is cheap: a job that dies on a compile error costs a few
minutes. A build that **hangs** bills to the job's timeout, and a hung job is
invisible — `dartvel build macos` once printed "Building for macos..." and then
nothing at all for five hours and fifty-six minutes before GitHub's own 6-hour
cap killed it. At the macOS 10x multiplier that single job cost more than every
other job across four runs combined.

Two guards followed. The hook can no longer block indefinitely (`db93571b`),
and every job now carries `timeout-minutes: 45` (`d568dff9`) — generous
against a sub-ten-minute successful build, and roughly an eighth of what one
hang cost.

### What a macOS run actually costs

Measured on run 32201351600, which was given an 8-minute cap against a $1
budget and hit it:

| Phase | Time |
|---|---|
| Flutter setup, `cargo install cbindgen`, `pub get` | 2m33s |
| Rust runtime compile, inside the build step | ~2m36s |
| `flutter build macos` before the cap | ~3m (incomplete) |

Setup is most of a short run, and at the 10x multiplier it costs more than the
build it exists to enable. Both halves are now cached — the cbindgen binary,
and the Rust target directory keyed on the crate's own sources — so a repeat
run should reach Xcode in about a minute rather than four and a half. Budget a
macOS attempt at **15 minutes** (~$1.20 uncached, considerably less warm);
8 was sized from the iOS job's total and did not account for a full Xcode
application build.

Unselected matrix entries are gated at the job level rather than in a step,
because a skipped step still starts a runner: three four-second gated jobs on
that run billed roughly 22 minutes between them.

**Runner minutes are billed against the repository owner's account, and this
repository is public — so they are unlimited and free on standard runners,
Windows and macOS included.** The multipliers above apply only to private
repositories.

That was assumed the other way round for a while, and the assumption did
damage worth naming: the macOS binding job was narrowed to a single suite, the
platform matrix was kept manually triggered, and Apple targets were bundled
into one job — all to save minutes that were never being spent. Scope was
rationed against a cost that did not exist.

Wall-clock time is still real, and a hung job still occupies a runner for
hours. Bound jobs with `timeout-minutes`, not by leaving things out.

## Distribution images

`sony-elinux-iso` and `sony-elinux-img` build the bundle and then report that
image assembly needs the configured Sony eLinux imaging toolchain. Dartvel does
not bundle one and does not emit a placeholder file in its place. These formats
are excluded from `dartvel build` with no argument, since they are explicit
packaging steps rather than part of a general build.

## Launch splash

`dartvel build` writes the splash each target shows before its first frame,
from `dartvel.splash` (see [getting-started](getting-started.md)). What it
writes, and what it leaves alone:

| Target | What is written | Verified |
|---|---|---|
| `web`, `web-server` | A stylesheet in the head and an element first in the body of `build/web/index.html`, so every prerendered page has it; `dartvel-splash.png` beside it when there is an image. The engine appends `<flutter-view>` after the splash, so the application covers it as soon as it paints, and a `flutter-first-frame` listener then removes it. Hidden with scripting off, where the page's content is the noscript block | In Chrome, by pixels: `test/native_splash_browser_test.dart`, with a negative control for each claim |
| `android`, `fireos` | `values/dartvel_splash.xml` and `values-night/` (the colour), `drawable/` and `drawable-v21/launch_background.xml`, `drawable-{mdpi…xxxhdpi}/dartvel_splash_image.png`, and `values-v31/styles.xml` and `values-night-v31/`, because from API 31 the system draws its own splash and ignores a layer-list window background | Files unit-tested; not yet run on a device |
| `ios` | `Base.lproj/LaunchScreen.storyboard` naming the colour `DartvelSplashBackground`, whose colorset carries the dark appearance, and `LaunchImage.imageset` at 1x, 2x and 3x | Files unit-tested; not yet run on a simulator. iOS caches launch screens, so a change can need the app deleted and reinstalled to show |
| `macos` | One marked line in `MainFlutterWindow.swift` setting `flutterViewController.backgroundColor`. The window is visible at launch and FlutterView is black until the first frame | Unit-tested; compiled by the macOS CI job |
| `linux` | The template's `gdk_rgba_parse(&background_color, "#000000")` in `my_application.cc`, which is the colour behind the view. The GTK runner already shows its window only on the first frame, so there is no blank window to paint. **Light colour only**: the runner has no dependable way to read the desktop's dark preference | Unit-tested |
| `windows` | **Nothing, deliberately.** `flutter_window.cpp` registers `SetNextFrameCallback` and shows the window from it, so the window does not exist on screen until Flutter has drawn | — |

The embedder targets (`tizen`, `sony-elinux`, `webos`, `fuchsia`, `tvos`,
`vscode`) and the browser extensions get no splash yet: their launch is owned
by the vendor embedder or the host, and none of them was checked for what it
shows before the first frame.

A platform file is replaced only while it is still Flutter's template or
carries the `dartvel:splash` marker. One designed by hand is left alone and
the build says so; `dartvel.splash.overwrite: true` replaces it. Deleting the
marker comment from a written file hands it back.

## When a target skips

`dartvel build <target>` skips rather than fails when the toolchain says it
cannot serve, and the message names which wall it hit. There are three, and
CI passes a skip only for these — a skip that says nothing is still a
failure, and so is "not found on PATH", because an embedder that should have
been installed and was not is a regression rather than a wall.

| Wall | What is printed | Why it is not a failure |
|---|---|---|
| Licence-gated SDK | `Skipping tizen` with `Tizen Studio SDK` | Dartvel must never install it, so no runner can ever produce a TPK |
| The embedder's Dart is below the floor | `bundles Dart <version>` before anything is generated, or `the embedder resolved with Dart <version>` when the embedder has no CLI to ask and its own pub is the first thing to say so | The vendor ships that Flutter. Nothing in the project can change it, and its pub refuses to solve before a file is compiled |
| A vendor dependency this machine cannot produce | `needs tools Dartvel cannot install for you` | The Sony eLinux embedder artifacts come from a separate workflow; a build runner has no way to make them |

Each re-arms itself. The day a vendor ships a newer Flutter, or the artifacts
are in place, the skip stops happening and the artifact check applies again —
so a target cannot stay green by continuing to skip once the wall is gone.

Before this, webOS and Fuchsia failed on every run with a true message about
the wrong thing: their scaffolds were written, their own pub refused the SDK,
Dartvel deleted the half-written directory and reported that it could not
generate a scaffold. Sony eLinux skipped correctly and the job failed anyway,
because the step after it demanded an artifact from a build that had just
explained why there was none.
