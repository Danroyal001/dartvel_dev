# Q28: which specification sections genuinely warrant `Contract`

Asked and delegated ("you check"), and never actually checked until now. This
is the data, so the decision is made from evidence rather than memory.

`stability` and `status` are independent on purpose: the rule files state that
"a frozen contract that is deliberately unbuilt is the scope rule working, not
a gap". So nothing below is a rule violation. What follows is the shape of the
commitment currently being made.

> **Read the counts below with this in mind.** Seven of the rows in this
> audit were never sections of the specification. `spec_status_check` read
> any line beginning with `# ` as a heading, and NEW_SPEC.md is full of shell
> samples whose comments start the same way, so the index carried entries for
> `Mobile`, `Web`, `Desktop`, `etc.`, `.dartvel.sh`,
> `Television, embedded, and extension platforms` and
> `Complete Sony Embedded Linux system images` -- all of them comments inside
> one ```bash block. They were removed on 2026-09-07 and the parser made
> fence-aware. The shape of the argument here still holds; the totals are
> seven too many.

## The numbers

55 sections carry labels. The other 20 are narrative prose — Philosophy,
Design Goals, Mental Model, The Vision, Takeaway — and correctly carry none.

| stability | status | count |
|---|---|---|
| Contract | Shipped | 22 |
| Contract | Partial | 14 |
| Draft | Partial | 14 |
| Draft | Designed | 5 |

## The 14 worth a decision

These freeze an API surface whose implementation is only partial. Freezing a
surface before anyone has built against it is a guess about what users will
need; freezing one that is finished and depended upon is a promise worth
keeping. These sit in between.

## Recommendation

Narrow `Contract` to what already has dependents that would break: `DVBox`/
`DVText` (UI), Routing, and Models. Studio, the generators and every example
already build on those three, so they are frozen in practice whatever the
label says.

For the 14 above, `Draft` costs nothing today and buys room to change a
surface that real applications have not yet pushed on. The label can be
raised once something depends on it; it cannot be lowered without breaking a
promise.

This is a recommendation, not a change. Nothing in spec-status.json was
edited to produce it.
