# Multi-Window on Flutter — what actually happens on stable, and on master

**Date:** 2026-09-01 · **Flutter:** 3.44.5 stable (engine `d3a3293399`) and
master `7ddb90b4` · **Host:** Ubuntu 24.04, Xvfb, Mesa llvmpipe

`docs/proposals/2026-08-multiwindow.md` labels the desktop rows *Experimental*
because Flutter's windowing API is behind a flag. That label is right, but it
does not say **where the wall is**, and the difference matters: a flag that is
merely off can be turned on, whereas an embedder that cannot present a window's
layers cannot be worked around from Dart.

This is the measurement. It was run because a projection application — an
operator window on one display, output full-screen on a projector — is the
first Dartvel use case that a second window is not optional for.

## What is present on stable, and what is not

| | on stable 3.44.5 |
| --- | --- |
| Framework API (`RegularWindowController`, `RegularWindow`, `WindowingOwner`, `WindowingOwnerLinux`) | **present**, in `package:flutter/src/widgets/_window*.dart` |
| Engine symbols (`fl_view_new_for_engine`, `fl_view_new_sized_to_content`, `fl_view_get_id`, `fl_view_monitor_new`, `fl_window_monitor_new`) | **present** and exported by `libflutter_linux_gtk.so` |
| `flutter config --enable-windowing` | **listed**, and setting it reports success |
| The flag actually reaching the app | **no** |
| A Dart-created window that survives | **no** |

The config setting is inert on stable, and `features.dart` says why:

```dart
const windowingFeature = Feature(
  name: 'support for windowing on macOS, Linux, and Windows',
  configSetting: 'enable-windowing',
  runtimeId: 'windowing',
  master: FeatureChannelSetting(available: true),   // master only
);
```

Only `master` declares `available: true`, so on stable
`featureFlags.isEnabled(windowingFeature)` is false, the tool never adds
`--dart-define=FLUTTER_ENABLED_FEATURE_FLAGS=windowing`, and
`isWindowingEnabled` is false at runtime. The tool also refuses the define when
passed by hand, naming `flutter config` as the way to set it — which on stable
cannot set it.

**The flag is not the wall.** `isWindowingEnabled` is a mutable top-level
`bool`, so an app can assign it before touching the API. Doing that gets past
every framework guard: controllers construct, `runWidget` returns, and X11
shows the windows being created. The wall is one layer down.

## The measurement

Four builds of the same app, identical Xvfb and Mesa environment, sampled every
five seconds for twenty-five seconds. `FL_IS_COMPOSITOR` counts
`fl_compositor_present_layers: assertion 'FL_IS_COMPOSITOR(self)' failed` on
stderr.

| probe | Dart-created windows | `FL_IS_COMPOSITOR` failures | survives 25s |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `runApp`, no windowing API | 0 | **0** | **yes** |
| `runWidget` + 1 `RegularWindow` | 1 | 1 | no, dies ~2s |
| implicit `View` + 1 `RegularWindow` | 1 | 1 | no, dies ~2s |
| `runWidget` + 2 `RegularWindow` | 2 | 2 | no, dies ~2s |

One compositor failure per Dart-created window, exactly. The control rules out
the environment: the same binary, the same display, the same software GL, with
`runApp` instead of `runWidget`, ran the full twenty-five seconds with a mapped
1280x720 window and produced neither error.

A `BadAccess` GLX error follows each run, and it is a consequence rather than
the cause — the compositor assertion is logged 117 ms earlier, and the control
produces neither.

## What this means

`fl_view_new_for_engine` creates the view, and nothing on the embedder side
binds a compositor to it. That is not reachable from Dart, from an FFI binding,
or from anything Dartvel can write. **`window.open` cannot be honestly
registered on Linux against this engine**, and `DVWindowingCapability.detect`
is right to gate `multiWindow` on the binding existing rather than on the API
being importable.

The third probe is worth stating separately, because it was the most promising
theory and it is wrong: giving the implicit view its own content, so the
runner's own window is not left empty, does not help. The failure is attached
to the *new* view, not to the implicit one.

## A second view is the wrong unit. A second engine works.

Two further probes settle it.

**Creating the window after the first frame changes the outcome.** Every probe
above built its controllers in `main()`, before `runWidget`, when the engine is
not yet up. Deferring creation to `addPostFrameCallback` produces a real window
that renders: `MEDIA-BITS-PROJECTOR`, 1280x720, white text on black, and the
process survives past twenty-five seconds with no `BadAccess` at all.

It also exposes the actual limit. The **implicit view went black** at the same
moment. Adding a third view repeats it: with implicit + operator + projector,
only the projector renders and the other two are black, with two
`FL_IS_COMPOSITOR` failures rather than one.

| views | renders | black | `FL_IS_COMPOSITOR` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| implicit + projector | projector | implicit | 1 |
| implicit + operator + projector | projector | implicit, operator | 2 |

**Stable's Linux embedder presents one view per engine — the most recent one.**
Each added view displaces its predecessor and logs one assertion failure. That
is a property of the compositor, not of window creation, which is why no amount
of care about ordering or implicit-view content fixes it.

**So give each window its own engine.** The runner creates two `GtkWindow`s,
each with its own `FlDartProject` and `fl_view_new`, told apart by the Dart
entrypoint arguments:

```c
make_window(application, self, "MB8-OPERATOR",  900, 600,   0, 0, "operator");
make_window(application, self, "MB8-PROJECTOR", 1280, 720, 940, 0, "projector");
```

```dart
void main(List<String> args) {
  final role = args.isNotEmpty ? args.first : 'unknown';
  runApp(RoleApp(role: role));
}
```

Result: **both windows render at once**, in one process, from one binary, on
one launch. `FL_IS_COMPOSITOR` failures: **zero**. Screenshots of each window
show its own content — operator black-on-white at 900x600, projector
white-on-black at 1280x720.

The first capture attempt showed the operator black and it was an artefact, not
a result: both windows were placed at `+0+0`, so `import -window` on the lower
one grabbed the screen region the upper one covered. Moving them apart resolved
it. Worth recording because it looked exactly like the failure being chased.

## Master does what stable cannot

Everything above is stable. Master was measured second, and it changes the
answer, so the engine-per-window conclusion below applies to stable only.

Master's API has moved on: `RegularWindowController` is now `WindowController`,
`RegularWindow` is `Window`, `preferredSize`/`preferredConstraints` are
`size`/`constraints`, and there are dialog, tooltip, popup and satellite window
kinds plus a `WindowRegistry` and a `LinuxWindowRegistrar`. `_window.dart` is
884 diff lines from stable's; code written against one will not compile against
the other. The feature is still `master: FeatureChannelSetting(available: true)`
and nothing else, but master adds an `environmentOverride: 'FLUTTER_WINDOWING'`
that stable has no equivalent for.

**On master, two windows on one engine both render, sharing one widget tree.**
A `String` held in the root `State` above both windows, changed once by a single
`setState`, appears in both windows at the same time:

| | operator window | projector window |
| --- | --- | --- |
| before | `OPERATOR / BLANK` | `PROJECTOR / BLANK` |
| after one `setState` | `OPERATOR / AMAZING GRACE` | `PROJECTOR / AMAZING GRACE` |

`FL_IS_COMPOSITOR` failures: **zero**. `BadAccess`: **zero**. The process stays
alive. The stable measurement's central finding — one view per engine, newest
wins — does not reproduce on master at all.

## The one rule that holds on both channels

**A window must be created after the first frame has been *rasterized*, not in
`main()`, not in `initState`, and not in `addPostFrameCallback` either.**

The post-frame form was the first version of this rule and it is wrong.
`addPostFrameCallback` fires after build, layout and paint, but before the
raster thread has presented anything, and a window created there still ends the
process. It was caught by building a real application on the binding: the
package's own tests passed, and the application died on launch until a two
second delay was put in front of `open()`. A delay is not a rule, so the signal
had to be found — `WidgetsBinding.instance.waitUntilFirstFrameRasterized` — and
the timing moved into `DVWindowHost`, where no application can get it wrong.

The original, weaker statement: Every early probe built its controller before the engine was up,
and on both channels that ends the process with a GLX `BadAccess`. On master it
does so even for a *single* window, which is what makes it look like a broken
feature rather than a lifecycle mistake: the plain-`runApp` baseline on master
runs fine, one `Window` built in `initState` dies, and the same one `Window`
built from `addPostFrameCallback` lives.

That is worth encoding rather than documenting. `DV.Platform.Window.open` should
own the timing so no application can get it wrong.

## Two capture artefacts that read exactly like failures

Both cost time, and both would cost it again.

**Occlusion.** `import -window <id>` on an unredirected X11 window returns the
screen region, not the window's own pixels, so capturing a window that another
one covers yields the *other* window's content — or black. Two separate probes
looked like "the second window renders and the first is dead" purely because
both sat at `+0+0`. With no `xdotool` or compositor available, the fix was to
size the windows so their content does not overlap and take one root capture
showing both.

**Reading a single sample as a result.** The stable probe that reported the
process alive had been sampled before the crash. Sampling on a fixed schedule
until the process exits is what turned that into a real answer.

## What this means for `DV.Platform.Window.open`

Build it on master's single-engine windowing:

- `multiWindow: true` and **`sameEngine: true`** on desktop. One engine, one
  widget tree, one isolate. Cross-window state is ordinary Dartvel state — a
  signal read in both windows — not the shared store, and not a sync protocol.
- The window is still a route, as the proposal already has it.
- `open` creates the window after the first frame, so the lifecycle trap above
  cannot reach application code.

The cost is the one that matters and it is not technical: **this needs Flutter
master.** Every embedder fork is pinned to a verified stable, and the
`docs/build-targets.md` evidence is against those pins. Adopting master for
windowing means re-verifying each target against it. That is a project decision,
not a windowing one, and it should be made explicitly rather than arrived at.

## Verified through Dartvel, not only through Flutter

`packages/dartvel_windowing` registers the binding, and a real application was
built against it and run under Xvfb:

```
E2E presentation=DVWindowPresentation.window
    degradation=DVWindowDegradation.none
    id=dv-window-1
```

Two OS windows, `e2e` at 1280x720 and `E2E-PROJECTOR` at 620x420, both
rendering, process alive, and zero `FL_IS_COMPOSITOR` or `BadAccess` in stderr.
A `ValueNotifier` declared above both windows and changed once shows in both:
captured at four seconds both read `BLANK`, captured at twelve both read
`AMAZING GRACE`. That is the claim `sameEngine: true` is making, tested rather
than asserted.

The first attempt at that capture proved nothing and looked like it proved
everything: both captures landed *after* the change, so both windows read
`AMAZING GRACE` in a way a pair of constants would also produce. The captures
have to straddle the change.

## What a window manager changed, and why (2026-10-09)

Every run above was on a bare X server. On 2026-09-01 the same two-window app
was run under openbox and died with a GLX `BadAccess`, while one window under
the same openbox was fine. Which of "two windows", "a window manager" and
"software GL" was at fault was left open, and with it whether this would
fail on every real desktop. It has now been taken apart on Flutter 3.47.5
stable, on a virtual two-monitor desktop: Xorg with the dummy driver and two
RANDR outputs (DUMMY0 and DUMMY1, 1920x1080 each), and Xvfb, both with
openbox and Mesa llvmpipe.

**First, a stable-only wall in front of it.** On 3.47.5 the projector never
opened at all: `RegularWindowController` threw "Windowing APIs are not
enabled". `WidgetsBinding` chooses its windowing owner when it is
initialized, before any application code, and with the flag still false it
chooses the unsupported one. Assigning `isWindowingEnabled` afterwards did
not replace it. `DVFlutterWindowSurfaceFactory.enable` now installs
`createDefaultWindowingOwner()` after setting the flag.

**Then the crash.** With `GDK_SYNCHRONIZE=1` under gdb, catching the
`exit_group` the X error handler ends in:

```
_exit <- gdk_x_error <- _XError <- libGLX.so.0 (libglvnd) <- gdk_gl_context_make_current
      <- gdk_window_begin_draw_frame <- gtk_main_do_event   (GTK main thread)
```

The `BadAccess` on `X_GLXMakeContextCurrent` is raised **inside libglvnd**,
not by the X server: libglvnd refuses to make a GLX context current on a
thread where a context from another API (EGL) is current. Tracing
`eglMakeCurrent` and `glXMakeContextCurrent` per thread shows exactly that:

| thread | call | from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| main | `eglMakeCurrent(ctx)`, never released | the embedder's realize handler for the new view (`gtk_widget_realize`) |
| main | `glXMakeContextCurrent(paint ctx)` -> `BadAccess` | GDK painting a toplevel |

Flutter's Linux embedder renders with EGL; GDK 3 paints a window that has a
GL context with **GLX**. When a second view is realized while the engine is
running, the embedder leaves its EGL context current on the main thread. If
GTK paints before the engine next tidies up, the process ends. A window
manager is what makes GTK paint first -- reparenting, configure and expose
all arrive right after the window maps -- which is why the bare server
survived. It is a timing race, not a software-GL limit, and libglvnd is how
Mesa and the NVIDIA driver both ship, so **it would have failed on real
desktops too**.

Controls, all on the same build: Xvfb without a window manager survives;
Xvfb with openbox dies; Xorg dummy dies with or without openbox, and with one
monitor or two, because its expose timing differs from Xvfb's; and
`GDK_GL=disable` survives everywhere, which confirms GDK's GL paint as the
victim but is not a fix (it gives up GL in GDK for every app).

**The fix** is in `dartvel_windowing`, where every Dartvel app gets it: right
after creating a window's controller, `DVWindowHost` releases the calling
thread's current EGL context (`eglMakeCurrent` with no context, through FFI).
Dart runs on the GTK main thread on Linux, so that is the thread the embedder
left it on, and the engine makes its context current again whenever it uses
it. With the fix the operator and projector windows ran under openbox on
both servers, through moves, maximise, and fullscreen toggles from the window
manager, and operator changes reached the projector.

**Fullscreen on a chosen display.** Flutter's Linux `setFullscreen(display:)`
ignores the display (its own TODO). `window.setFullscreen` is now bound on
Linux to `gtk_window_move` onto the display plus
`gtk_window_fullscreen_on_monitor`, the GDK monitor found by the display's
origin. Under openbox the projector came up `_NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN` at
1920,0 1920x1080, which is DUMMY1 exactly.

What is still unproven: a GPU driver (the race is the same, the timing is
not), a compositing window manager such as mutter or KWin, and hot-plugging
a projector while the app runs.

## Reproducing

The probes are four `flutter create` apps differing only in `lib/main.dart`,
built with `flutter build linux --debug`, and run under
`Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1920x1080x24 +extension GLX +extension RANDR +render` with
`LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 GALLIUM_DRIVER=llvmpipe GDK_BACKEND=x11`. Window
counts come from `xwininfo -root -children`.

The one non-obvious step is that the app must assign `isWindowingEnabled = true`
and call `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` before constructing a
controller; `RegularWindowController` reads `WidgetsBinding.instance`, so
building one first throws "Binding has not yet been initialized" and hides the
real result.
