// The unit tests drive a fake log, which proves the adapter's semantics and
// nothing about the wire format -- and this client hand-writes a v2 record
// batch, including its CRC-32C, which is exactly where a hand-written protocol
// goes wrong. Every live broker on this project has found a bug the fake
// agreed with.
