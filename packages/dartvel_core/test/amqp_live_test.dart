// The AMQP adapter against a real RabbitMQ.
//
// The unit tests drive a fake channel. That proves the adapter calls the right
// operations in the right order; it proves nothing about whether the bytes on
// the wire are the ones RabbitMQ expects, and a hand-written binary protocol
// is exactly where that goes wrong. The SQS adapter's first live run found a
// bug the fake had happily agreed with.
//
// Skipped unless DARTVEL_AMQP_HOST is set, so a developer without a broker
// gets a green suite rather than a failure they cannot act on.
