// Publishing to a store, as a plan the build can check before it runs.
//
// The specification asks Dartvel to handle publishing and distribution for
// every platform. Nothing did: `dartvel deploy` covers a web host and a
// server, and an application going to Google Play, App Store Connect or a
// tester group was a set of commands somebody kept in their head.
//
// The failures worth guarding are the ones that waste an upload rather than
// the ones that crash. A publish that starts, spends four minutes on a
// binary and then asks for a credential nobody gave it has failed after
// doing the expensive part; a publish to the wrong track has succeeded at
// the wrong thing. So the plan is resolved and validated first, and refuses
// with the line of pubspec.yaml that would fix it.
