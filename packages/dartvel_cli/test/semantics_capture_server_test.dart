// The little server the semantics capture drives a browser against.
//
// It serves `build/web`, which after `flutter build web` holds one
// index.html at the root and nothing else -- the per-route index.html files
// are written later, from the very capture this server exists to enable. So a
// plain static handler answers 404 for every route but `/`, the Flutter app
// never boots on those pages, no semantics tree is ever built, and the capture
// reports 1 of 4.
//
// That is what "Captured 1 of 4 routes" was: not a slow page or a missing
// browser, but three requests that never reached the application at all.
