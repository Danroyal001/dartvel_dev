// Background sync in the generated service worker.
//
// The PWA section lists it and nothing did it: a backend function call made
// while the network was gone simply failed, and the user retried by hand or
// did not. The worker now keeps an outbox -- same-origin requests that are
// not GETs and could not be sent -- and replays it, in order, when the
// browser fires `sync`.
//
// These tests read the generated script. A worker cannot run under
// `dart test`; what can be held here is that the right handlers are emitted,
// that the rules for what is queued are the ones the fetch handler already
// enforces for caching, and that the switch to turn it off turns it off.
