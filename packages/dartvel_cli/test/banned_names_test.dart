// Names the windowing contract says will never exist.
//
// The Multi-Window section closes this as a list: "No DVWindowManager, no
// DV.Windows, no DVWindowing -- not as a public type, not as a documented
// name, ever." A rule stated in prose comes back the first time someone needs
// a place to put something; a rule with a test does not.
//
// DVWindowManager is public API today: DV.Platform.window returns it. The
// contract says anything beyond DV.Window and DVWindow is private, but Dart
// privacy is per *library*, so a private class in src/windowing/window.dart
// cannot be the return type of a member in dartvel_flutter.dart. The clause is
// not implementable as written, so the name is recorded as a named exception
// rather than quietly dropped -- and the rule still catches a new one.
