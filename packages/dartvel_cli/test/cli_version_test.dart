// its own source tree and wrong everywhere else: a compiled binary invoked
// inside someone's project finds *their* pubspec and reports *their* app's
// version as the Dartvel CLI version. With no pubspec above it at all, it fell
// back to a hardcoded number that had already drifted -- the released 0.2.1
// binary announced itself as 0.2.0.
//
// A binary carries its own version. Nothing it finds on disk can tell it.
