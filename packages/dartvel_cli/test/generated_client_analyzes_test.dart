// The whole generated client, compiled against the real API.
//
// Every other generator test reads the emitted text, and text that reads
// correctly still fails to compile. Four such defects shipped at once in
// models.g.dart, and separately every admin route generated a *private*
// DVRoutes member — the target existed and no application code could name it.
// Both classes of bug are invisible to string matching and obvious to the
// analyzer.
//
// So this generates a project the way `dartvel build` does — router, models,
// jobs, static paths, backend, and the admin pages — resolves it against the
// real dartvel_core and dartvel_flutter, and analyzes the lot.
//
// It costs a `flutter pub get`, which is why it lives in its own file: the
// rest of the generator tests stay instant.
