## 0.4.0

- `dartvel build android` writes the Activity, the capture provider and the
  permissions an application declares under `dartvel.android.permissions`,
  plus the two permissions the framework binds whether or not a project asked:
  `VIBRATE` and `USE_BIOMETRIC`. Both are normal permissions, granted at
  install with no dialog, which is exactly why their absence was invisible --
  the application ran, the binding was registered, and the call threw where
  nobody was looking.
- Only normal permissions are ever added on a project's behalf. A dangerous
  one would put a question in front of its users that its author never wrote,
  and there is a test asserting `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT`, `CAMERA`,
  `READ_CONTACTS`, `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` and `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` never
  appear in a manifest that asked for nothing.
- `dartvel db migrate` runs the statements it prints. It used to print a line
  per model, say they were synced successfully, and execute nothing at all.
  For Postgres or MySQL it writes the statements out and says it did not run
  them, because the CLI has no connection to a managed database.
- Declared middleware runs. Ten of the nineteen keys now reach the generated
  router in the order declared; the annotation previously had one reader, a
  check that the name was spelled correctly, which then dropped the list.

## 0.3.2

- Corrected the constraints on sibling Dartvel packages, which named the
  previous release rather than the one published alongside them. A caret on a
  0.x version stops at the next minor, so `dartvel_core: ^0.2.1` excluded the
  0.3.1 published beside it -- a user installing the 0.3.1 set resolved 0.2.x
  for every sibling and got none of what that release contained. `dart pub
  publish --dry-run` could not see it, because it resolves against
  pubspec_overrides.yaml and every sibling points at a local path.

## 0.3.1

- `dartvel update` fetches the latest published binary and replaces the running
  one, verifying its checksum first and keeping the old binary alongside. A
  no-op when already current.
- `@DVFunctionalWidget` generates a widget class rather than a function, so a
  generated component can be const and can reach a BuildContext without every
  caller threading one.
- Lowered page and widget bodies carry the imports they were written against,
  and a body that reaches for a private symbol is refused with a message naming
  it rather than emitting generated code that does not compile.

## 0.3.0

Four queue brokers, both network databases reachable over TLS, static
generation that produces pages, and a page that can have a body.

### Queues, on real brokers

Seven adapters now: in-memory, database, Redis, SQS, RabbitMQ, Pub/Sub and
Kafka. The four that talk to a network service are verified in CI against the
real thing -- ElasticMQ, RabbitMQ's own image, Google's emulator and Apache
Kafka -- rather than against a fake that agrees with whatever the adapter does.

That distinction found nine bugs which every unit test had passed: a backoff
sent as an initial delay, an AMQP channel limit above the server's,
delivery-mode written to the wrong bit, publishes returning before the broker
had them, a payloadType that would have stopped every handler matching, a Fetch
reply parsed with three fewer fields than it has, offset commits sent to a
broker that was not the group's coordinator, and a first coordinator lookup
that is always refused and always retriable.

Each adapter is written around what its service actually offers. SQS and
Pub/Sub refuse `pending` rather than returning an empty list, because an empty
list reads as "there is nothing" when the truth is "I cannot see". Kafka is a
log, so it has no dead letters, no priority and no out-of-order retry, and
`lag` gives the honest version of a backlog: a distance, not a list.

### Databases

PostgreSQL and MySQL both negotiate TLS, which is what a managed endpoint
requires -- Aurora, Neon, Supabase, PlanetScale and Cloud SQL all demand it and
most refuse plaintext, so before this the adapters reached localhost and
nothing else. `sslMode` takes libpq's names, so a connection string copied from
a provider's console pastes in unchanged.

A refusal is fatal at `require` and above. Falling back would put the password
on the wire in the clear while the caller believed the connection was
encrypted.

### Pages can have bodies

A private `@DVPage` input had to be a single expression, so every page needing
a local, a loop or a condition was written as a one-line wrapper around a
public helper. Block bodies are lowered into the generated widget now.

`@DVFunctionalWidget` and `@DVBackendFunction` still require expression bodies.

### Static generation

`dartvel build web` writes a page per route and expands parameterised routes
through the application's own resolvers. `@DVModel(generatePublicPages: true)`
now generates the route as well as the paths -- it previously produced a list
of addresses that all resolved to the application's own not-found page.

A page no route serves is refused rather than written.

### The web output

Crawler-visible HTML is built from the page's semantics tree rather than from
string literals in the source, so it carries real headings, anchors and
landmarks instead of one paragraph per source line. Pages gained structured
data, a stylesheet for `sitemap.xml`, and an `.htaccess` that path URLs need
and that nothing was writing.

In-app links push the route instead of tearing the document down and rebuilding
the whole application, which is what a real anchor in the semantics tree does
by default.

## 0.2.1

- First published release.

Dartvel's packages are published under the `dartvel_dev` name on pub.dev.
`dartvel` was taken on 2026-08-06 by an unrelated package, so the published
identifier carries a suffix while the command stays `dartvel`.
