/// The server configuration a Dartvel web build needs to actually serve.
library dartvel_cli.build.server_config;

/// An `.htaccess` for Apache, which is what shared hosting runs.
///
/// `dartvel build web` uses path URLs rather than Flutter's hash strategy, so
/// every route is a real URL — and a real URL has to be served. Prerendering
/// writes a file per known route, but a route with a parameter has no file,
/// and neither does anything added after the last build. Without this the
/// host answers its own 404 page.
///
/// Everything here is a rule about failure:
///
///  * the rewrite is guarded by `mod_rewrite`, because a bare `RewriteEngine`
///    on a host without the module is a 500 — a worse failure than the one it
///    fixes;
///  * existing files and directories are served as themselves, or the rewrite
///    swallows `main.dart.js` and the page loads `index.html` as its own
///    JavaScript;
///  * `.wasm` is served as `application/wasm`, because
///    `instantiateStreaming` refuses anything else;
///  * `index.html` is not cached, because it names the hashed bundles and a
///    cached copy keeps pointing at the previous deploy — the deploy that
///    appears to have done nothing.
