/// The Android half of a declared kiosk: a lock-task launcher.
///
/// The specification's production path is an artifact that "starts in kiosk
/// at boot", with "no window of unlocked UI at startup", and it names what
/// that is on each platform -- eLinux images, Windows assigned access, and
/// Android lock-task launchers.
///
/// A lock-task launcher is two things in the manifest and nothing in the
/// Dart. The application has to be a HOME activity, or pressing home leaves
/// it; and it has to carry a device-admin receiver, or `dpm set-device-owner`
/// has nothing to point at and lock task shows the "pin this screen?" dialog
/// to somebody who is not there. Neither can be added at run time, which is
/// why this is a build step and not an API.
