/// Publishing an application to a store, as a plan that is checked first.
///
/// The specification asks Dartvel to handle publishing and distribution for
/// every platform. `dartvel deploy` covers a web host and a server; an
/// application going to Google Play, App Store Connect or a tester group was
/// a set of commands somebody kept in their head.
///
/// The failures worth guarding are the ones that waste an upload rather than
/// the ones that crash. A publish that starts, spends four minutes on a
/// binary and then asks for a credential nobody gave it has failed after
/// doing the expensive part; a publish to the wrong track has succeeded at
/// the wrong thing. So the plan is resolved and validated before anything
/// runs, and every refusal names the line of pubspec.yaml that would fix it.
