/// Flutter web renders to a canvas and only emits real DOM elements for the
/// semantics tree. With no tree there is nothing for the browser to focus, so
/// the first Tab is spent entering the canvas and every stop after is off by
/// one — a keyboard user presses Tab, nothing visibly happens, and they press
/// it again. With the tree, links are real elements the browser tabs to
/// directly.
///
/// And a screen reader only works when the tree exists. Flutter builds it on
/// detecting assistive technology, which is a guess: it misses a user who
/// turns their reader on after the page loads, and it misses browsers that do
/// not advertise. For a website that guess is not worth making.
///
/// The cost is the tree itself, which is built anyway the moment anyone with
/// a reader arrives.
/// The handle is held, not discarded.
///
/// `ensureSemantics()` returns a handle that keeps the tree alive; dropping it
/// releases the request immediately. The first version called it and threw the
/// handle away, which left the browser showing Flutter's "enable
/// accessibility" placeholder button instead of the tree — semantics offered,
/// not switched on, and Tab still landing on the canvas.

/// tore the document down and rebuilt the whole application to move between
/// two routes. Measured rather than assumed: a marker set on `window` did not
/// survive a link activation.

/// pushes the route; anything that is not an in-app link is left alone, which

///
///  * a modified click — ctrl, meta, shift or alt — because those mean open in

///  * `target` other than `_self`, and any anchor carrying `download`;
///  * another origin, another protocol, and `mailto:`/`tel:`;
///  * a fragment on the current page, which is a scroll rather than a route;
