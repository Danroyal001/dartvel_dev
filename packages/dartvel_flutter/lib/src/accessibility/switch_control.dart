// Switch control and hardware-key navigation.
//
// A kiosk or an embedded device is often driven by something other than a
// touchscreen: one or two switches, a TV remote's D-pad, a keypad. Switch
// control turns a page into something one or two keys can drive -- one steps
// focus through it in traversal order, another activates what is focused,
// and a timer can do the stepping for a single-switch user. Hardware-key
// navigation maps a remote's D-pad and select key onto focus and activation
// with nothing switched on. Kiosk blocks escape, never access: the keys this
// needs are exempt from any hardware-key block, and [DVAccessibilityKeys]
// says which they are.
