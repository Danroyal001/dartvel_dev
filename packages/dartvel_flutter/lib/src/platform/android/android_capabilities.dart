///
/// Absent, with reasons rather than "not yet":
///
///   * **Notifications** need a notification channel created at run time and,
///     since API 33, a permission the user grants. Both belong to the
///     application, not to a binding.
///   * **Biometrics and NFC** need an `Activity`, not a `Context`:
///     `BiometricPrompt` attaches to one and NFC dispatch is delivered to it.
///   * **Window controls** do not apply — an Android app owns no resizable
///     window.
///   * **`screen.geometry`** would come from `WindowManager`, whose modern API
///     returns metrics through classes that vary by API level. Flutter already
///     reports the same numbers, so a binding would add a second answer that
///     can disagree with the first.
