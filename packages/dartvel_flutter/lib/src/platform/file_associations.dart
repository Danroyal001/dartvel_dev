/// target that has a way to register them. [DVFileAssociations.opened] is
/// where those files arrive, the same way on every one; see

/// The build writes the declaration -- a `.desktop` file and MIME info on
/// Linux, document types into the macOS plist, a registry script beside the
/// Windows binary -- and on Windows and macOS somebody still has to run an
/// installer for any of it to take effect. An application that was copied
/// into place, or that gained a file type after it shipped, opens nothing:
/// double-clicking its own document offers a list of other applications.
///
/// So the same declaration can be registered at run time, for the user who
/// is running the application. Per-user, always: registering for every user
/// on the machine needs administrator rights, and an API that asked for them
/// would be one most applications could not call.
