/// Every native binding name Dartvel calls, in one place.
///
/// A binding name is a bare string on both sides of the bridge, and
/// `DVNativeBridge.invoke` returns null when nothing is registered under the
/// name it was given. That is right -- an unbound capability degrades rather
/// than throws, which is the whole capability model -- and it means a typo is
/// indistinguishable from an unsupported platform. `window.setTitel` compiles,
/// registers nothing, invokes nothing, and returns null on every target for
/// ever.
///
/// So the names are declared here and a test checks the source against this
/// list, in both directions: a name used but not declared is more often a typo
/// than a new binding, and a name declared but never used reads as support
/// that exists.
///
/// Being in this list does not mean a platform implements it. Most of these
/// are bound on some targets and not others, which is what
/// `DVNativeBridge.isRegistered` is for.
