// DV.Test.fakeWindowing, the explicit windowing fake.

// windowing was silently absent". Without a fake, a test asserting that a
// route presents as a page passes on a CI runner for the wrong reason -- not
// because the code degrades correctly, but because nothing registered
// window.open and the capability was false anyway. The same test would have
// passed with the degradation logic deleted.
//
// So the fake is named, and the capability it installs is stated at the call
// site rather than inherited from whatever the host happens to be.
