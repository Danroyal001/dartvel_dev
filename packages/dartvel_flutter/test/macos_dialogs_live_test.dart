// The macOS file panels, on their own.
//
// They are served by another process -- com.apple.appkit.xpc.
// openAndSavePanelService -- and on a runner without a full window server
// session that process sometimes takes this one with it. package:test then
// marks every test after the one that was running as failed, so a wobble in
// the file chooser threw away twenty results about the clipboard, the tray,
// printing, the device APIs and the serial port.
//
// Three real faults were found and fixed before this file existed: a panel
// left on screen after its modal was stopped from code, a run-loop timer
// armed for every dialog and invalidated for none, and an open panel asked
// for a name field it does not have. What is left is the panel service, and
// it is not this code -- so the panels live here, run as their own step, and
// a bad day for them costs only their own results.
//
// A separate file rather than a tag: flutter_test's group() takes no tags,
// which is a compile error the analyzer reports and the runner hides behind
// @TestOn on any machine that is not a Mac.
