// or a second launch reached a process that then exited, and the running
// application never heard about it. "Second launch focuses the running app"
// was true of the lock and false of the application.
//
// The contract routes an external request through the same idempotent open(),
// so a link to an order already on screen focuses that window rather than
// opening a second one.
