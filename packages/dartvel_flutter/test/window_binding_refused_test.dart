// DV-WINDOW-006: the one `error` in the window registry.
//
// The specification separates the platform saying no (DV-WINDOW-004, an OS
// window limit, a denied task) from the binding being missing or refusing
// (DV-WINDOW-006): the first is a capability limit the fallback was built
// for, the second is a platform integration defect that must not be dressed
// up as graceful degradation. Both were reported as 004, so a broken binding
// looked like a full desktop.
