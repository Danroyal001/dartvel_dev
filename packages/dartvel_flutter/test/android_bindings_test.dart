// Android platform bindings.
//
// Android was the one platform with nothing, and the reason given was that
// package:jni exposed no application Context. The answer written here then
// was GetApplicationContext(), from package:jni's C header — which is
// declared there and never defined, so every binding this file asserts was
// dead in every real application until an emulator said "undefined symbol".
// The Context now comes from a ContentProvider `dartvel build android`
// writes, and the Activity that the permission dialog, the camera and the
// picker need comes from a transparent Activity written beside it.
//
// The intended fallback was wrong too, and generation proved it —
// ActivityThread is hidden and absent from the public android.jar, so jnigen
// found every other class and reported that one "Not found".
//
// This suite runs anywhere and asserts the capability list and the refusal to
// register off-Android. The bindings themselves need a device, and the
// emulator job in runtime-verification is where they are exercised.
