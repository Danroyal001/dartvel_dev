// Every native binding name Dartvel uses, declared in one place.

// A binding name is a bare string on both sides. `DVNativeBridge.invoke`
// returns null when nothing is registered under the name it was given, which
// is correct -- an unbound capability degrades rather than throws -- and it
// means a typo is indistinguishable from an unsupported platform.
// `window.setTitel` would compile, register nothing, invoke nothing, and
// return null forever, and the feature would simply never work on any target.
//
// So the names are declared, and this checks the source against the
// declaration. A new binding has to be added deliberately; a typo is not in
