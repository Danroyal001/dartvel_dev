// The reconciler between DVWindowManager's window list and the OS surfaces
// that render them.
//
// Two rules carry the weight. A surface is never created before the first
// frame, because building a window controller while the engine is still coming
// up ends the process with a GLX BadAccess rather than an exception -- on
// Flutter master that happens even for a single window. And a window that
// degraded to a page must never get a surface, or the route would be presented
// twice.
