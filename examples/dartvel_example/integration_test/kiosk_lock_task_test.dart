// Kiosk enforcement, on the device it is meant to run on.
//
// This is the test that was impossible until the Activity became reachable.
// Lock task mode belongs to an Activity, and the application Context that
// package:jni hands back is not one — so kiosk on Android was recorded as
// blocked and asserted nowhere. A widget test cannot tell a kiosk that holds
// from one that returns a map saying it did.
//
// What is checked here is what the platform did, not what Dartvel said. The
// enforcement result carries `lockTask`, and Android's own ActivityManager is
// the second opinion: the emulator step reads `dumpsys activity` afterwards,
// so a Dart-side bool that lied would still be caught.
//
// Run with: flutter test integration_test/kiosk_lock_task_test.dart -d emulator-5554
